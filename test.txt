564	0	Blue chips are falling faster than a Russian soldier out of a helicopter into Ukraine.   Inflation is nearing an all time high.  If you don't post absolutely OUTSTANDING earnings, you tank..  OR, you still post terrible guidance and pop over 30%.  The market has been propped up by the fed the past year and a half by just printing MORE money.  Hence the high inflation.  I ain't no üåàüêª. In fact, I'm a permabull. However, this market is creeping into a place it's never been before and the 'tech' we thought was untouchable, is dropping dramatically.  If this is part of a cycle, then be prepared for SPY under 400  Especially with fed rapidly raising rates.

If Oracle were to leave Russia, it would prevent all Russian businesses from being able to deal with one another. Oracle has enough soft power in order to end the war in Ukraine in a single day, and as fellow Redditors I ask you whether or not you can ethnically support a company who refuses to stand by and do nothing while Ukraine suffers.  It's time to put your money where your mouth is.
185	1	Wow!  So  figured id  share this morsel of grief..Tucker Carlson just did a  segment with Peter Schiff.. Schiff  stated the  inflation print of  7.9% is  grossly understated..according  to Schiff, the  basket that made up the cpi numbers in the 70's is not the  same as current. If it were the  numbers would be over  15%!    And  rising dramatically.!  For guys like me who use barrels of diesel and pallets of  lumber it is certainly higher than 15%  ..  I watched an interview with the  ceo of microstrategy, his thesis was inflation  for the avg joe mirrors the  annual gains of the  s&amp;p  annually?   I remember having a  convo about being on the  cusp of  a  german mark moment a few months back.. starting to feel more and  more likely ..gd!   Question: what is the  REAL rate of  inflation?  This  new  1.5t  spending  package takes it to where from here.. ? How many more times can we increase the money supply before USD shits  the  bed?  Thoughts?

181	1	Well today was quite the exciting day if you ask me!   After many saw that pre-market spike to 433.22 they thought we for sure had a green day secured in the bag. Only thing was the markets had something else planned that many did not expect and those who played the market as it lies were rewarded greatly!   https://preview.redd.it/son0vjqcavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc65e2a536cdfa6da3ca839b3e377686f99c4d7  When I look at this chart I actually see the STRONGEST put signal from 0815am this morning all the way until right now as market is closing. The crazy thing that if you were to block all the white noise, all the Biden speech pumps, all the Russia bs, all the pumps and dumps intraday and you looked at this chart here. You would see that in almost 14 hours of trading there was only ONE 15 minute candle closed above the 8 ema. That is some hella bearish movement. You could have entered a put at market open and not touched it till end of day and easily made 100-200% gains on your puts. However, of course intraday we have so much going on we can not be so objective.   Technical wise today had you just watch the 8 ema you would have been sitting pretty. But of course we have the classic sell off as Biden speaks followed by a big rally which we saw attempt to happen two times today. We also saw the VIX peak near 30.4 at 955am this morning and continue to fall as SPY continued to fall, which was interesting to watch. However, we saw around 240pm the VIX go on a massive fear run breaking its 8 ema and peaking at 31.04 before market closed.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zu6t15tdavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9721c49c51293f43bc48b26eb1754aeb0aa99fe8   if you follow me and were in the live chat today intraday around noon I mentioned SPY was testing its upward channel support and that if it broke the 424 support we would be breaking the channel and should see a big run down which can to happen exactly as I had mentioned. That‚Äôs why watching not only intraday but daily trends is so important.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/es3skajfavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4637043c677b12d440eac3e4c580a7926fb496f3   Which leaves us with this very nice looking bear channel that I also mentioned to keep an eye on. We have officially hit the upper resistance with that pre-market move to 433 and now naturally it makes sense to see it test the support line which puts SPY next week testing support levels between 400 and 410. If you remember last time SPY hit its new lower low of 410 it immediately sky rocketed back up‚Ä¶ we very well may see some of that same movement happen next week.    &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/pnix2xigavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad74cba66f0f82571a4740043329461c42c893e  As mentioned this morning and intraday in the live what does this chart show you? Does it show you a bull chart or a massive bear chart? We are 100% without a doubt in a bear market. Even CNBC said we are super close to triggering their ‚Äúextreme bear market‚Äù indicator that hasn‚Äôt hit since 2008 I guess.   Todays intraday movement and this daily candle finish was very important to me and very foretelling for what is going to happen next week. We have a bearish engulfing candle on the daily, we once again after breaking the daily 8 ema failed to close the candle above it. Looking at the EMAs the daily 8 and daily 20ema are damn near falling straight vertical down now we have such a bearish sentiment on the chart. The daily 50 ema closed in even closed to the daily 200 ema leaving only $3.5 left before the death cross happens‚Ä¶ We could see this death cross play out as early as Friday next week if we see some similar movement as this week and fail to make any significant upward movement.   If you remember next week we have the oh so awaited first rate hike and FOMC meeting on Wednesday. It is going to be VERY interesting to see not only what JPOW has to say but what he chooses to do with the rate hike. Remember Thursday markets despite expected CPI did not like it and sold off still. I think next week we are going to see some fireworks on Wednesday and Thursday. IF I was a betting man its going to be the same thing as last week on Wednesday when JPOW testified we saw a fuck you green day followed by 4 very red days.   10% challenge-  This was not my best week but overall a good week. I was attempting a few different strategies and pushing myself past my comfort zone and it did not pay off. I look forward to getting back to my tried and true method that works out well for me. But overall it was a good week.   I made 15 trades and had 8 green and 7 red.   Goal of the week is $2500/ week or $500/ day  I managed to net a profit of $1100 this week averaging a terrible 4% on the trades I made.   Next week I need to get back on my game and back to the strategy that‚Äôs never failed me. No more pushing hard or making risk trades for no reason at all.   &amp;#x200B;  How did you guys do with the 10% challenge?

Sure, some went to pay the wages, but mist were pure profit.  In time people spend more then they earn, everyone will need more money, money that is locked now in purchased assets leading to a recession.   Cash will become extremely valuable.  Printing money is off the table now for most governments.  Due to Russia war, devaluing the dollar us not am option anymore, the deal is made using yuans...  We are going for deflation and recession next few years, keep your cash liquidity and buy when every assets price will crash soon.

Once the share price hits $2,000 Papa MUSK will announce a 10:1 split. This will lead to doubling of the valuation to $4 Trillion Market Cap hence overtaking Microsoft and Apple.  Once it is the largest public company by Market Cap, Elon will announce another two Giga factory probably by end of this year. Once he does that Market Cap will reach $5 Trillion.   This year Tesla is slated to produce approximately 2 Million Cars with Berlin and Austin factories coming online, the factories will be in full production by next year and another two factories going online they will be able to produce 5 million cars at the end of 2023. By 2025, they will be producing around 10 million cars hence by that time or end of 2024 Tesla will reach a Market Cap of $10 Trillion Dollars.  Position: $1000 Calls. Exp 03/25.

It's traders buying bonds and then traders looking at the bond yield changing because so many are buying them....this isn't a prediction, it's a result of actions, it's people looking what other people have done and like a bunch of sheep or lemmings saying "oh look everywhere I see people are running this way, better run too" and then oh boy look a recession....yes because yall made it so more than anything else.

638	1	ViacomCBS is primed for an incredible earnings quarter call. I‚Äôm going to try to keep this shorter than it should be by keeping this post mostly focused on VIAC as a short term earnings play, but this stock is also an incredible pure long play as well. DD for long term investors is linked at the bottom of this post.   A few numbers and charts might be slightly outdated (by a week maximum). I started working on this DD last week, so a bit of my data is old!  VIAC Current Valuation-   ViacomCBS as of market close on February 9 is currently valued at a 23.30B market cap, 7.02 P/E, and 9.14 forward P/E, and At this valuation, the company screams value trap. Forward PE is currently being dragged down by Q4 2021 EPS estimates, but I will discuss that later in this post. VIAC is a dying company in a stagnant industry with 0 revenue growth and a limited future? Wrong.   First, let‚Äôs look at their topline. VIAC‚Äôs 2020 revenue was 25.03B, while their TTM 2021 revenue is 26.81B. Additionally, their current average 2022 revenue estimate is 29.29B. Low revenue growth, but certainly not a dying company deserving a P/E ratio of 7.  Now, let‚Äôs look at the valuation of peers in the streaming industry below. The chart is a little bit outdated, but the numbers are approximately still the same. All streaming companies generally trade at a forward P/E generally greater than 20, excluding DISCA, which is trading at lower valuations relative to its peers due to its unfavorable merger/acquisition terms with AT&amp;T‚Äôs WarnerMedia.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/dzsv858shqh81.png?width=1230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb5dfa0e72127d25614362863a10affc205aee6  There are no similar hurdles in the upcoming future for ViacomCBS. **The market is simply completely discounting ViacomCBS‚Äô streaming arm and its current progress.** Cable TV accounts for around 45% of VIAC‚Äôs current revenue, and because CableTV provides 12-13B in revenue annually, cord-cutting concerns are a major point of worry for investors, company‚Äôs executives and overall company long term health. VIAC‚Äôs executives, however, clearly recognized these concerns, which is why they acquired PlutoTV in 2019 for $340 million and launched their own streaming platform in March 2021.   Since its release in March of 2021, Paramount+ has already driven Viacom to accumulate 47.4 million subscribers- 4.3m in Q3 and 6.5m in Q2 of 2021 alone. In addition, PlutoTV generated over $1B in ad revenue in 2021 and has surpassed 55m monthly active users- an incredible investment by ViacomCBS. In 2020, PlutoTV had 33m MAU‚Äôs and 450m annual revenue. Its growth in the past year is astounding.  PlutoTV namely, along with Roku, and Tubi are currently the leading cable killers. Although VIAC is losing cable customers and their revenue, it‚Äôs gaining them right back through PlutoTV.   Current Outlook  In 2021, this stock has been completely shafted by the implosion of Bill Hwang‚Äôs fund, general bearish sentiment toward VIAC, and tax-loss harvesting. However, the stock found a bottom in late December 2021 and has been slowly climbing its way back up in 2022.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/lif64y6thqh81.png?width=2286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44bc15daa5591282f041446449811f262d60a42a  https://preview.redd.it/x98s4hlthqh81.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06d3f694e4f2d14992aee6f5aad7f673aae733a  An incredible earnings report with absolutely blowout streaming numbers could initiate a large rally to at least $40 for this stock- likely way higher. The most likely scenario for said rally would be initiated by the market finally gaining faith in Viacom as a legitimate streaming company. If VIAC‚Äôs next earnings report sufficiently blows expectations out of the water, this company might finally see a much-deserved streaming valuation. Even a price/earnings ratio of 15 would see VIAC doubling from its current valuation. A 10 million subscriber quarter would be a great start- and this is exactly what we‚Äôll be seeing.   VIAC will double if it‚Äôs valued at a genuine streaming company. On February 15, VIAC will be announcing Q4 earnings, announcing full 2021 financial results, and hosting an investor event providing an update on Paramount‚Äôs momentum and the company‚Äôs content and IP . **A quarter with an increase of 10 million new subscribers and a well laid out plan by VIAC executives on the future for Paramount+ would finally give VIAC the credibility it needs as a legitimate streaming play.** Luckily for us, we can use Google trend data, cyclical industry trends, and look at updates from VIAC executives, which we can use to estimate subscriber growth and next quarter‚Äôs bottom line.   First, we can look for Paramount+ Google Trends activity.  Starting from Q4, there is a massive spike in Google user interest in Paramount+. In Q2 of 2021, Paramount+ added 6.5m subscribers, while in Q3, they added 4.3m. Based on past Google Trend activity, we are set to see a massive increase in subscribers in Q4. However, we need to dig deeper. Why has activity spiked?  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/a8qpv0euhqh81.png?width=2316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42a3acdc7502f361f357010c8eec79348844c319  **T-Mobile partners with ViacomCBS.**   [In early November of 2021, T-Mobile partnered with Paramount+. They now offer a free year of Paramount+ to all customers with either cellular or internet plans. ](https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/paramount-plus-deal)  [In that same week, Paramount announced that they added one million new subscribers. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/11/17/clifford-helps-paramount-add-1-million-new-subs-in-a-week/?sh=5616310e3fbd)  You know what people enjoy? Free stuff. T-Mobile has a lot of customers- over 100 million of them. Let‚Äôs say 50% of those subscribers have cellular or internet plans. 5% of cellular or internet customers redeem their free Paramount+ membership last quarter. That‚Äôs 2.5m subscribers alone. This estimation is generously underestimated, but you should get the idea. This partnership with T-Mobile should not be underestimated.   Based on Q3 and Q2 numbers, we can estimate that base subscriber gain (without the positive catalysts I will be discussing- like the T-mobile partnership) would‚Äôve been approximately 5 million. Let‚Äôs add 2.5 million subscribers from T-Mobile's partnership. We are already at 7.5 million subscribers in Q4.   **Football**  Next, we can look at football. Q4 of VIAC‚Äôs fiscal year overlaps with NFL regular season, so we can expect a large boost in viewership from the NFL season ramping up into full swing. But that isn‚Äôt all. This year‚Äôs NFL season was incredible.   In the 2021 regular season, NFL viewership saw an increase of almost 10% in ratings from those in 2020, and a 6-year record in viewership at 17.1million. [CBS saw a nine per cent increase for its regular season games, posting a 21.59 million average audience across its ten national game windows](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/nfl-tv-ratings-2021-regular-season-viewership/). Guess who streamed the most viewed game of the regular season? That‚Äôs right. CBS. [The Dallas Cowboys featured in five of the 2021 regular season‚Äôs ten most watched games. This included the Thanksgiving matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders on CBS, which became the most-watched NFL regular season game on any network in 31 years, drawing in 40.8 million viewers. This was only the second regular season game to eclipse the 40 million mark since 1988.](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/nfl-tv-ratings-2021-regular-season-viewership/) And guess where CBS NFL games are available? That‚Äôs right. Paramount+.   But the NFL is just part of the story. CBS has the streaming rights for the SEC. Viewership last season was record breaking, and for the championship game last season it [peaked at almost 18m](https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/cbs-reveals-huge-ratings-numbers-for-sec-championship-game/) viewers. It wasn‚Äôt just the championship game though- viewership for the SEC was at an all time high,[ especially on CBS. ](https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2021/11/sec-ratings-cbs-most-watched-game-week/) And obviously, a portion of these viewers signing up for the game to be streamed on Paramount+. Google trend data is available below.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/t5zgealvhqh81.png?width=2310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf40bef5bf9898b6efdb54a67e142516cac358c6  Since Paramount+ was released in March of 2021, until Q4, it has barely seen any growth from true, regular season football. Let‚Äôs estimate that NFL and SEC streaming contributed to a 1 million subscriber gain for Paramount+. Q4‚Äôs net subscription gain is already at 8.5 million.   **New Shows- Yellowstone and Kingstown**  In Q4, Paramount+ also had two new shows, 1883, and Kingstown, which both debuted on Paramount+, the former of which drew record viewers. [Supporting the company‚Äôs claim for 1883‚Äòs big debut on Paramount+ over the first 24 hours of release is the delivery of the premiere‚Äôs airing behind Yellowstone on Paramount Network. The promotional linear telecast drew strong 4.9 million total viewers in Live+Same Day, according to Nielsen, making it the biggest new series premiere on cable since 2015 (AMC‚Äôs Into the Badlands, which followed juggernaut The Walking Dead at the height of its ratings supremacy).](https://deadline.com/2021/12/1883-yellowstone-prequel-paramount-plus-premiere-record-ratings-paramount-network-viewership-1234900017/)  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img 4r1mw9gwhqh81...*  [For comparison, another new Taylor Sheridan drama series for Paramount+, The Mayor Of Kingstown, logged 2.6 million viewers for the special airing behind Yellowstone (7.5 million) on Paramount+ for a 35% retention. (Into the Badlands premiere‚Äôs TWD lead-in retention was 50%).](https://deadline.com/2021/12/1883-yellowstone-prequel-paramount-plus-premiere-record-ratings-paramount-network-viewership-1234900017/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/whyabelxhqh81.png?width=2418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a496fbd5683998cf731fce25901a9cd2afa62bb5  Q4 of every fiscal year always sees a massive increase in subscriber growth. For reference, Disney added 11.8 million subs in its most recent quarterly earnings report last week, yet in the quarter before, it had only added 2 million subs. Netflix sees a similar effect (its quarterly subscriber growth chart is available near the bottom of this post). Netflix gained 4.4 million subscribers in Q3 of 2021, and 8.3 million in Q4. I‚Äôm not totally sure why there is always such a massive spike in subscriber growth in the last quarter of every year, but I will attribute this cyclical effect to Christmas gift-giving and other holiday boosts.   Let‚Äôs make another conservative estimation and say that Kingstown, Yellowstone, and cyclical seasonal factors gives Paramount+ a 1.5 million subscriber addition. We are not set for a 10 million subscriber growth quarter for just Paramount+. Awesome  **November Update-**   ViacomCBS‚Äôs Bob Bakish also [updated us in November on Paramount‚Äôs growth](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2454570376257/viacomcbs-ceo-streaming-revenue-crosses-5b-annual-run-rate). In the current fourth quarter, total streaming revenue is crossing an annual run rate of $5 billion, Bakish shared, adding: ‚ÄúWe are getting somewhere significant pretty quickly.‚Äù ViacomCBS said in February that it expects to grow its streaming revenue to $7 billion by 2024, up from a then-current run rate of $3.6 billion.  What‚Äôs this mean? 20% streaming revenue growth QoQ at the very minimum. Streaming revenue in Q3 of 2021 was 1.08B. At 5B ARR, we are looking at 1.25B streaming revenue in Q4. With the current pipeline of content that is coming to Paramount+ (Halo Movie, Scream, Sonic 2, etc.), I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if VIAC is able to achieve $9-10B streaming revenue by the end of 2024. CableTV is responsible for around $12-13B revenue, based on VIAC‚Äôs current declining CableTV revenues, it‚Äôll still be providing at least $10B revenue in 2024. VIAC will continue to see top-line growth for the next 5 years.   **EPS**  Now, let‚Äôs talk about EPS estimates for Q4. The EPS estimate for Q4 is at an all time low of 0.45. First of all, that‚Äôs fucking ridiculous, and VIAC was definitely going to beat estimates regardless of any special factors. Wall street analysts are suddenly expecting the bottom line to decrease by 40% just because they would be investing more into streaming? That‚Äôs ridiculous.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/g7635j42iqh81.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d19b7a44a4be102e3de82377a16fdab5b0218234  In the last 5 years, VIAC has never had a single quarter where its reported EPS was below 0.75. 0.45 EPS is ridiculous.   However, VIAC is guaranteed to smash this 0.45 EPS estimate out of the park. How do I know this? Last November, they announced their [Studio City Lot](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-11-30/viacom-sells-cbs-studio-radford-lot-hackman) in LA for 1.85B, and the deal was expected to close by the year‚Äôs end. With how ridiculously inflated LA real estate is these days, we can definitely expect that the proceeds were significantly above book value. What does this mean? Net income for Q4 will be significantly higher than expected, especially with analyst estimates already so low. In the last 3 months, the EPS estimate for VIAC has only constantly been brought further and further down.  Q3 Guidance: [Total company revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. Adjusted OIBDA fell three percent to one billion as we continue to ramp up programming and production spend coming out of COVID and increase our investment in streaming. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.76. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of $187 million in the quarter, reflecting a ramp in programming spend, including our investment in streaming. Adjusted free cash flow in Q4 should reflect a continuation of this trend.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/04/viacomcbs-inc-viac-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcrip/)  Less FCF. Certainly. A 40% drop? Unwarranted. 0.60 EPS is far more reasonable.   Let‚Äôs make a small estimate for EPS if we factor the Studio City Lot. The Studio City Lot was sold for $1.85B and auctioned off to the highest bidder. **As of September 30, 2021, VIAC had an estimated $1.809B worth of property and equipment on its balance sheet. Let‚Äôs estimate that The Studio City Lot had a book value of $1B - likely far higher than it should be. If we disregard taxes, the land sale will result in an $850 million dollar boost in earnings in Q4. Based on VIAC‚Äôs outstanding shares (between 600-650 million), we can estimate that this one-time land sale will cause an EPS boost of $1.31/share, disregarding taxes. That‚Äôs 3x higher than current EPS estimates, and that‚Äôs disregarding VIAC‚Äôs true bottom line. EPS will be a blowout. Amazon mooned on an EPS blowout thanks to their Rivian gains. I think we see a similar effect here.**   **VIAC literally sold their Studio City Lot for $50 million higher than the book value of all of their property and equipment listed on their Q3 balance sheet.**   &amp;#x200B;  [Estimated EPS Next 12 Months](https://preview.redd.it/y0bv1ro6iqh81.png?width=1768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95aecdd2af711b3168b90b5dc97fe3cec40278c)  [ViacomCBS Q3 2021 Balance Sheet- Total Property and Equipment Valued at 1.809B ](https://preview.redd.it/yobnq679iqh81.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e0777403d60235d574795354429080222f7aec)  &amp;#x200B;  **Licensing and Possible Acquisition**  The most powerful players in the streaming wars are Netflix, Disney(+Hulu &amp; ESPN), Amazon, and HBO &amp; Discovery once they merge. A quarter of **ALL** Amazon, Peacock, and Netflix content is licensed from VIAC.   [ViacomCBS Content Licensed to Other Streaming Platforms](https://preview.redd.it/pkuo7vjdiqh81.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8676712fc4993d640dca5157c54e45e75e3455cf)  &amp;#x200B;  The streaming wars are just beginning, and in this industry, content is king. And guess who owns a veritable mountain of IP? ViacomCBS. As Disney and HBO take back content rights from rivals to improve their own streaming libraries, Viacom‚Äôs own licensed IP becomes more valuable and even more important when it comes to strengthening content selection and variety. Their leverage has grown ever stronger at the negotiations table when it comes to licensing content to other providers and it will continue to improve in the next few years. We can expect even higher content licensing revenue to continuously increase in the future.   [‚ÄúContent licensing is an important business but ‚Ä¶ our strategy is clearly evolving, particularly with Paramount+,‚Äù Bakish said. The company has a library of 4,000 films, 140,000 TV episodes and current production of 150 series globally. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt keep all that for ourselves. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs too much,‚Äù he said.](https://deadline.com/2020/11/viacomcbs-ceo-bob-bakish-on-licensing-content-we-cant-keep-all-that-for-ourselves-the-upfront-production-ramp-1234610307/)  Although Bob has stated otherwise last year, the threat of VIAC pulling a Disney/Warnermedia hangs over Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix like a dangling sword. VIAC could decide to go all in on its streaming platform, pull its content from its rival platforms, and go all-in on Paramount+. This would be a massive hit for VIAC‚Äôs revenue and earnings, but the threat remains. This threat, however, is what makes VIAC so valuable if acquired by Netflix, Amazon, or even Apple (lol).  An acquisition by Netflix or Amazon would allow it to pull VIAC‚Äôs content from the other platform, dealing a massive blow to a competitor. The acquiring company would gain an enormous library of content, streaming rights (CBS NFL rights are incredibly valuable), and Paramount Studios, whose recent movies include Jackass Forever, Scream, Clifford the Big Red Dog (lol), Sonic the HedgeHog, The Tomorrow War, and A Quiet Place.   The most recent quarterly earnings reports of both Disney and Netflix have shown deep, systematic problems with Netflix. It‚Äôs losing the streaming war. In Q4, Disney added 11.8 million subscribers, allowing it to accumulate 200 million subscribers across Hulu, ESPN, and Disney+. In the same quarter, Netflix added only 8.3m subscribers, which missed its guidance of 8.5 million subscribers. Netflix has a total of 222 million subscribers, up less than 10% YoY compared to Disney‚Äôs. Disney+ on the other hand, grew 37% YoY. Netflix‚Äôs growth is slowing, while Disney‚Äôs is also accelerating.   &amp;#x200B;  [Netflix Subscriber Growth in the Last 5 Years- Decelerating](https://preview.redd.it/dycynchhiqh81.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aafdc19596af8d8da882119f73f8c121b405c770)  Netflix does not have the IP or the firepower to compete against Disney, and in the long run, they will lose the streaming wars. In order to continue its growth, Netflix must acquire VIAC. An all-stock transaction similar to AMD-XLNX (an arbitrage play I made in the last 6 months!) might be the best path for Netflix.  Disney acquired 21st Century Fox for $71.3B (One of the Big 6- Paramount, Walt Disney, Universal, Sony, 21st Century Fox, and Warner Bros)  Amazon acquired MGM Studios for $8.45B  Discovery acquired WarnerMedia for $45B  It is unlikely Redstone would sell VIAC, but in the event that she does, based on past acquisition prices, the buyout price for ViacomCBS would easily be in the $60-100B+ Billion range. At minimum, we‚Äôd see 2.5x upside from current prices. VIAC‚Äôs current 23B market cap is ridiculously undervalued.   **PlutoTV**  In the last twelve months, PlutoTV has seen an annual growth rate of 100% YoY in both revenue and subscribers. That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. At over 1B annual revenue as of Q3 2021, if valued as a separate public entity, it‚Äôd easily be valued at 5-10B market cap alone.   **Streaming Arm**  VIAC has accumulated 50m subscribers across its streaming platforms. Netflix has 220 million subscribers. At a 175B market cap, if we applied the same subscriber valuation multiple from Netflix, VIAC‚Äôs streaming arm would be worth $40B. At half the subscriber valuation multiple, VIAC‚Äôs streaming arm would be worth $20B. This would be disregarding PlutoTV, content licensing, Cable TV, and all of VIAC‚Äôs most profitable cash-flow generating assets.   **Positions**\- Approximately 5-6k in weekly and monthly calls.   200 shares.  10-15k in $25 2022 September, $30 Jan 23, and $45 2023 and 2024 LEAPS.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/0mzdd0tjiqh81.png?width=2182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcbfab410b06ac070fc453b8d40298b184615e1b  **What Could Go Wrong? Hedging**  The biggest risk for VIAC FD‚Äôs would be macro effects. The market will likely sell-off ahead of FOMC minutes release on Wednesday and will dump hard with a genuine Russian invasion of Ukraine. Personally have hedged with a combination of 5% OTM SPY and 10% OTM TQQQ puts. SQQQ calls or QQQ puts would also work. Option premiums are priced for a very large move next week, but puts will still print hard if Russia invades Ukraine. Although VIAC went up 7% last week even with Ukrainian fears and inflation issues, it will 100% dump if SPY drops 10%. This kind of earnings play needs a hedge due to current macro factors.   **VIAC Pure Long DD**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyx6tx/viac\_god\_tier\_way\_too\_long\_dd\_all\_aboard\_the\_p/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyx6tx/viac_god_tier_way_too_long_dd_all_aboard_the_p/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r9sd8r/the\_viacomcbs\_viac\_saga\_part\_iii\_return\_of\_hwang/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r9sd8r/the_viacomcbs_viac_saga_part_iii_return_of_hwang/)  Seeking Alpha has some pretty good DD on VIAC, too.   &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: VIAC is valued as a dying company even though their topline will likely see at least 10% annual growth for the next two years. They‚Äôre going to post a net +10 million subscribers quarter, blow out EPS estimates, announce that they're to fully concentrate on streaming growth, and finally, attain a streaming company's valuation. Earnings and a streaming investor event are on Tuesday. Buy short-dated calls on VIAC and hedge with puts on broad market ETFs in case of market-wide issues. I expect at least a 10% move upwards from current share prices at the minimum.   Disclaimer- I'm a college kid who trades options for fun.
553	1	Did your fancy stock tracker that follows Pelosi not catch this one? Well it's true. [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/09/congress-moves-towards-banning-members-from-trading-stocks.html), and now the [Federal Reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/fed-approves-rules-banning-its-officials-from-trading-stocks-bonds-and-also-cryptocurrencies.html) too, are moving to implement bans on owning individual stocks and other undiversified securities. This is obviously an unmitigated good, taken on out of the goodness of their hearts in response to public outcry. The response has been [overwhelmingly positive](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s2c3j4/theres_a_growing_push_in_congress_to_limit/) on this sub and elsewhere.   But y'all are forgetting that crocodiles always win.  2019, 2020, and 2021 were great years for the stock market. If you were halfway competent and could control market outcomes, you are sitting on an absolute pile of unrealized gains. So now the Fed and congress are stuck - they've pumped, but they can't dump without a big tax bill. So the plan is to take a page out of the [Trump playbook](https://www.yahoo.com/news/how-trumps-wealthy-cabinet-picks-can-avoid-a-massive-tax-bill-for-now-190106460.html) (and the [Biden playbook](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cabinet-certificates-of-divestiture)) and completely put off paying capital gains taxes indefinitely while they sit back and plow their gains into nice safe index funds. I can absolutely assure you that these newly banned traders will be receiving [certificates of divestiture](https://www.oge.gov/web/OGE.nsf/0/D9246BEE2437F154852585B6005A17D1/$FILE/Certificate%20of%20Divestiture%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf) (yes, I know this is specific to the executive branch, but you better believe the rule makers are going to make rules that let them take advantage of this) in order to sell high without paying any taxes. These certificates allow the recipient who has been forced to divest assets with capital gains to defer paying taxes on those gains so long as they reinvest the sale proceeds into a permissible alternative investment.  TL;DR - Congressional and federal reserve trading bans are going to result in a big tax advantage for those affected by them.
551	0	I got a 10 year investment thesis for my portfolio. One segment is in space industries (RKLB, SPCE, ASTR, etc.) - to the moon eventually üöÄüöÄ.   But secondly, agriculture. A little bit of DD here and there, and my retarded existential crisis cannot be suppressed any longer. It's depressing and bad.   So at the time of writing, we have AppHarvest, a business strategy to counteract all the depressing apocalyptic things coming our way in agriculture. At a 300 million market cap, this sustainable robotic farming startup feels like investing in the agricultural equivalent of Tesla. At this stage, it's like investing in Tesla during the early 2000s.

354	0	As many of us know nearly all growth companies, even those with good fundamentals and consistent growth have been absolutely shit on. Assuming the economy doesn‚Äôt collapse sometime soon most of them will return to their former glory in the next 3-50 years. BYND is not fucking one of them.  So what I mean by insider info is that I work in a grocery store, more specifically the meat department. Laugh it up all you want but at least I‚Äôm not giving handys behind dumpsters to cover margin calls like some of u idiots. Now from what I‚Äôve seen since we started getting these ‚Äúmeat products‚Äù is a fairly obvious pattern. We get these disgusting piles of beetroot or whatever the fuck there made out of in. We put them out on the shelves, nobody buys them, they expire, we throw them out, they get automatically put back on order and sent to us and the cycle repeats. Here‚Äôs where it starts to get interesting. What I‚Äôve seen happen to other products that don‚Äôt sell is eventually they get put on DNO. I think it means Do Not Order but you‚Äôd have to ask my manager I‚Äôm not 100% sure. Once that happens the system will stop automatically sending more boxes in to us and we will no longer be purchasing items we don‚Äôt sell, you starting to see where this is going? Once enough stores put this hippie food on the DNO list, beyond revenue tanks and they stray even further away from profitability. Eventually having to sell assets to stay afloat, a final blow causing beyond to flatline.  Possible bull cases: 1. Hippies discover mind control and force everyone to go vegan, pretty self explanatory. 2. Other stores outside of the single one I work at are actually selling this shit not just stocking their shelves with it.  Does anyone know how to maximally profit off this? I‚Äôm pretty sure it will happen in less than 2 years but the lowest strike for options is 30 and cost 9. I don‚Äôt wanna short either bc only 100% gains are for pussys.  Disclaimer: this is obviously not financial advice, please do not arrest me for insider trading.

GME memestock shit aside, the whole writing reports, opening a position, giving reports to publishing houses to report as their own is some Bernie Madoff type shit.   At the SEC, usually these firms get a small fine and a trial by a Wall St. friendly judge. Half the time they don‚Äôt even admit wrongdoing and just pay the fine.  But the feds get to go over the helmet of the SEC. (fact:the SEC is pretty much darth helmet from SpaceBalls)  You see, charges by the feds aren‚Äôt just a cost of doing business fine and a trial by an appointed Wall St. friendly judge like the SEC. It‚Äôs federal sentencing with all the trimmings. Remember what happened to Madoff when he fucked up so bad?  Money certainly talks up the government, and can pull a lot of strings. But if you fuck up so blatantly bad or the government sees benefit in fucking you. Money is no recourse, they will fucking fuck you.

373	1	The bull thesis for Tesla is super strong right now. The big move today today coming on tailwind day for sustainable growth stocks and somewhat surprise news over the weekend that Giga Berlin was approved to start production and deliveries. It was held up in a water permitting issue that had enough FUD to move the stock over the last few days. Then days after the invasion, the permit is approved.   There‚Äôs a huge opening party planned in March and the Germans are going to make it a global and political statement about investments in energy independence and sustainability. This is the fucking super bowl of advertising.  Meanwhile Elon just delivered on his Starlink request to Ukraine almost immediately. This is insane, world changing shit. All done via Twitter. What a world.  Giga Texas deliveries start in 3 weeks and they are ready to start soaking up the backlog in demand of people who don‚Äôt want to pay $5 gas.   Today Lucid cut guidance from 20,000 to 12,000 deliveries this year due to supply chain issues. I bet Berlin and Texas are each doing 12,000 per month by December.  Time to double down. Never let a good crisis go to waste.

Economists say the housing market is softening.   Counterpoint: it could also just be a slow down caused by Omicron/supply chain issues.   The only problem with that is that the data they break down is from different regions. If Omicron/supply chain was the issue, it probably should have affected everyone in the same way. But the regional numbers vary widely.

132	1	Alright, retard, all opinions on memestocks and AMC squeeze shenanigans out the window for this post and comment section.ü§ù  We will focus on this AMC gold miner deformed dumpster baby that literally gets sketchier the deeper you really look.  But first, how greasy is this deal? [Greasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7FsAgPuVwU)  Let us dive in:  1st: Let me take this layup real quick, movie theatre executives don't know dick on how to fucking mine for natural precious metals. Coincidentally, this is about as close as a YOLO a corporate executive/board can go.  2nd: HYMC coincidentally drops an ATM stock offering this morning of up to 500 million unloading on apes as the stocks price launches. For those who don't understand, they are essentially able to soak up this 500% share price increase in taking a shitload of cash while massively diluting their shares. Isn't it odd that this was left out of the AMC press release and not spoken about at all on MSM today? Personally, I read an article in Barrons and NYT that completely failed to even mention it once. Side note: in a total dipshit move that makes Cramer look normal aaron [canceled](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1503763167473713155?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) his appearance on CNBC with a dumbass reply, what a fucking dweeb. Everyone knows in the era of Elon Musk, laws and court orders don't matter on Twitter and TV.  3rd: Goldminers largest shareholder is Mudrick Capital \~40% of stock outstanding. For you true autists, this is the same Mudrick Capital who bought 8.1 million shares of AMC stock in a closed offering and then sold the very same day. Wow, ain't that fucking weird.   4th: The movements of this stock before this announcement are fucking sketch as hell. Take a look at 2.50 strike [call](https://imgur.com/a/62YCIqU) open interest. So you telling me that some entity just decided to yolo massive amounts of money on massive OTM calls days till expiry on some shit profitless mining company right before a fucking movie theatre buys a massive stake? Call me sherlock holmes cause that's suspicious.   \-Granted, most of the volume for these options came in Friday at prices between .15 and .60 and the options barely got above .30. Nonetheless, sketch as hell. But the general movements of the stock before the announcement is undeniable.  4.5: This one isn't of any substance but I think it's worth something. This fucker took a picture with a sign in the middle of the desert as a showing of quality, no gold production or busty facilities. This is essentially if Elon Musk came out to woo his retarded investors with a new car model and instead of showing an actual car he shows a drawing.  Like fuck me, put me in charge of Wendys and I'll invest in Diane Fosseys Gorilla fund so apes can break free from behind the dumpster and frolic free in the wild while simultaneously solving climate change by making biofuel from their shit. No need to call me a hero.

Now I have already started my speculation career by trading options on spy and using my own research and speculation to profit which has so far been working, but I am not going to get cocky and act like I know exactly what I am doing and to be honest I still have a ton to still learn but I think I‚Äôm off to a decent start by starting to use a small part of portfolio to speculate on risky assets like options or single stocks. I really just have this burning desire to become the greatest and be a legendary investor/speculator/trader. For now I use it as a strong motivation to do my absolute best on my day trades, swing trades, long term investments whatever I am doing it doesn‚Äôt matter. Also yes I understand the risks I understand I will be facing possible devastating losses but I‚Äôm ok with it because I‚Äôve always been interested in finance and investing ever since I was super young and I‚Äôm seriously willing to do anything it takes but at the same time not get crazy and start falling into the ‚Äúgambling ‚Äú territory. Let‚Äôs see people I would love to hear what you guys got to say :)
758	1	Just wrote a blog post and thought it's worth sharing here to let retail know what's going on.  2021 was a great year for the market as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  rallied about 25%, which is significantly more than its average yearly  return. Many traders made money, but there was one group that made more  than most of us, and that was the group of US politicians. In 2012, the [STOCK ACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act)  was introduced to prevent the members of congress from using any  insider information to make trades, and require them to report their  trades within 45 days.  We are not sure how much is the rule followed these days by the members  of congress, but what we have seen over the last few years is how well  members of congress have been doing [extremely well](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/)  in terms of their performance in the markets. This could either be just  a coincidence, or they have more information than an average Joe.  Whatever the case is, the purpose of this post is to help retail traders  follow the congress trades to also earn profits like them.   ## Congress Trades   Since the STOCK ACT requires the members of congress to report their  trades within 45 days, we want to find a way we can  leverage those trades to find some edge in the markets. As soon as a new  trade by one of the members of congress is reported, we publish it in our [Congress Market Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-market) shown below.  https://preview.redd.it/6h8rtk99wig81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e51c5f81c661c86a30c88466de8495d93de2d06  This is every single trade that gets reported - one way we can think  about leveraging them is by simply taking the same trade. However, there  are a couple of issues there. First, not all members of the congress  outperform the market indices every year, only a few do. Second, these  trades are delayed by upto 45 days. Sometimes, the stock might have  already made a big move when they are reported, we want to be careful of  that. Finally, different amounts of money are spent on these trades,  and we want to weight them accordingly. The screenshot below shows the  top trades made by congressmen and women - millions of dollars going  into a trade should signify that these people are very confident in  their trades, and we should be okay in following them. Keeping these  limitations in mind, we try to solve them and end up with a solution.  https://preview.redd.it/dr1g8bjawig81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc86ed2285efa280d2150ce35de73d9c40735e5  ## Congress ETF   Looking at the historical data, we came up with a few observations.  First, many congress trades have a long time period i.e congressmen and  women do not enter into trades and exit immediately. This fixes the  issue of the 45 day delay although it does impact us somewhat in case  the stock has already made a big move before the report. Second, there  are many smaller trades and it is hard to use them well. When  significant money is being put into a trade, we want to weigh it more,  as it provides us more confidence. Finally, we want to be able to update  our picks as new data comes in. Based on these three observations, we  developed what we call a [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf) that combines congress trades in an intelligent manner and outperforms SPY.  At every day, the congress ETF takes the top 100 trades based on  their value and assigns them weights proportional to the amount that  went into the trade. The weights of the symbols are considered their  allocation, and it changes every day as new trades come in. Sold  positions are automatically removed from the ETF once they are reported.  Based on this dynamic allocation of symbols, we construct an ETF called  Congress ETF. Before diving into more details, let us first take a look  at the performance of the ETF and compare it to SPY.  https://preview.redd.it/q5wuo8tbwig81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf3bf4d88e81dd63240369cb6745e87b17c50934  Looking at the chart above, we can see that the Congress ETF outperforms [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY) by a factor of 2, which means it's twice as good as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY). If you've traded for a while, you would know that beating the markets i.e [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  is not an easy job, especially on a consistent basis. Now that we've  seen the performance, the question you as readers would have is how can  you actually use the ETF to earn money.  ### How do I follow Congress ETF?   In our [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf),  we keep a chart that shows the allocation of each symbol in the  portfolio. All trades are long trades, and the chart on average updates  every 1-2 weeks, since not many large trades are frequently made by the  congressmen and women. For instance, an example allocation could be MSFT  (40%) and AAPL (60%) which would mean if you have a 1000 dollars, you  should buy shares worth 400 dollars for Microsoft and worth 600 for  Apple. The chart below shows the allocation of symbols over time. There  are about 47 symbols in the ETF right now, but if that is a large number  for you, you can also pick up the top 10 symbols based on their bar  size in the chart  https://preview.redd.it/qxvoro4dwig81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2efc1622e322d365ca220f5d51c487f92bf189ab  If you look at the allocation chart, you can see how each new bar  comes after a week or two. That's because very large trades are rarely  made by politicians's, but whenever they are, we pick them right away,  and readjust the ETF. In future, we might automate and allow you to  simply do one click and put a fixed amount of money in the entire ETF.  But right now, the process is somewhat tedious and manual.  ## Congressmen &amp; Women ETF   As we discussed, the Congress ETF at the time of writing this  contains about 47 symbols, which can sometimes be too much to follow for  a retail user. In order to fix that, we also allow users to analyze  individual congressmen and women's portfolios. We employ a similar  process as described earlier on the construct the ETF, but on average,  there are at most 5-10 names in every politician's portfolio, making it  easy for retail traders to follow. But which members of the congress  should we follow? That's a good question and needs answering first.  https://preview.redd.it/e8qgcn9ewig81.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78f58a30d311f644be9b130c4fc13651cec7ad17  The chart above shows the average performance of each traded taken by  the best performing congressmen and women. If you've read the news  lately, it is no surprise to see the great Nancy Pelosi in there,  because she did quite well [last year](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/).  These are the people that we want to follow. Now let us take a look at  Nancy's portfolio and see how easy it is at Tradytics to follow her  trades.  ### Nancy Pelosi ETF   In order to get the dashboard for individual members of congress, you can head over to our [Individual Congress Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual).  The default search is already for Nancy Pelosi, so we will dive right  into her portfolio. The figure below shows her ETF performance, symbol  allocation, and the times when readjustments were made to the portfolio.  https://preview.redd.it/1z9bs9ifwig81.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=995e3c0b2f430147f6dbae3212e4f0834dffc6b6  Looking at the screenshot above, the first thing to note is that  although the congress ETF beat SPY by about 2x, the Nancy ETF actually  beat it by 2.6x which shows how good she has been trading lately. The  more important graph is the lower one that shows the allocation of each  symbol in her portfolio at every day the readjustments were made. In  contrast to the congress ETF, there are only about 10-11 symbols in her  portfolio and she only made new trades about a dozen times in the last  year, which is very manageable for retail traders as well. It is easy  for us to keep an eye on her positions in the [dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual) and follow them whenever they are reported.  ## Limitations &amp; Final Thoughts   Most people believe that the 45 day delay in reporting causes some  limitations in trying to follow congress trades. As discussed earlier,  that is obviously true to some extent but retail traders can still  follow positions even after that delay, and still be able to earn  similar profits as the members of congress. If you go ahead and take a  look at the trades tables in the dashboards, you will actually see that  many of the positions had not moved much before they were reported to  the public. That is also a criteria that you can use to follow trades -  only go into the ones that haven't moved much at the time of reporting.  Despite some of the limitations, we believe Congress trading is a good  source of generating alpha in the markets and can help retail traders  find an edge. As always, please always do your due diligence before  going into a trade, stay safe, and manage risk. Thank you for reading.

German Parliament just announced a ‚Ç¨100 billion  package for this year added once to the German armed forces and a definite implementation of the 2% of GDP spending on military moving forward.

5	1	 [***Link to Article***](https://archive.today/qfEff)  # ============  # ‚ÄúThese 3 Charts Strongly Suggest the U.S. Stock Market Has an Invisible Hand Propping It Up‚Äù By Pam Martens: March 23, 2022  As someone who has watched trading screens for the past 36 years, it‚Äôs pretty easy to spot a fake market. As the charts below indicate, there is an invisible hand (or hands) pushing this stock market up when it should be plunging. The likely suspects are U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen‚Äôs Plunge Protection Team, known as [the Exchange Stabilization Fund](https://archive.ph/9NWoh); foreign central banks that are aligned with the U.S. position on Ukraine and want to help stabilize financial markets in the West; hedge funds and [Wall Street‚Äôs Dark Pools](https://archive.ph/f2Pin) owned by megabanks that are net long the market; or a combination of all of the above.  One thing‚Äôs for sure, the stock market is not responding in a normal fashion to soaring inflation, a hawkish Fed, spiking interest rates, and military aggression by an out-of-control dictator with 6,000 nuclear warheads.  Consider the chart below: since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has skyrocketed by 20 percent, currently reaching 2.38 percent. That was a correct and normal reaction since inflation is already soaring in the U.S. and the military aggression is going to disrupt oil and gas supplies from Russia via sanctions, thus likely pushing commodity prices even higher. In a normally functioning stock market, an increase in yield of that magnitude on the 10-year Treasury note would have caused the stock market to plunge. Instead, per the chart below, the S&amp;P 500 stock index has actually risen 5 percent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  [Yield on 10-Year U.S. Treasury vs S&amp;P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://preview.redd.it/pd5nhoztv8p81.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d462a2bc74504de252a075b6a851985971a4e23)  The stock market‚Äôs bizarre behavior is further evidenced by the chart below. It shows how the S&amp;P 500 stock index has performed in relation to the S&amp;P GSCI commodity index since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Notice particularly how the dramatic spike in commodity prices between February 24 and March 8 was not met with a dramatic plunge in stock prices during that same period. It should have been. Then there is the equally important fact of a big yawn from the stock market as a nuclear power invades a sovereign nation of 44 million people, bombs its cities and towns to rubble, and persists in making threats against the U.S. and allies that are supporting Ukraine. Commodity Prices vs S&amp;P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine  &amp;#x200B;  [Commodity Prices vs S&amp;P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://preview.redd.it/ozi4gmw1w8p81.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893243bfe614a50f8e65d89fb41574107719410e)  And, finally, there is the disparate reaction of the stock market versus the correct share price reaction of the global banks that will be impacted by the Russian invasion. The chart below shows the radically different response from the stock market, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 index, versus global banks since February 1, 2022. We selected the date of February 1 because that was the point at which Russia had amassed 100,000 troops near Ukraine‚Äôs borders, backed up with tanks and artillery. The global banks shown on the chart below are those with significant exposure to Russia. The worst performing of these, Austria‚Äôs Raiffeisenbank, has lost 50 percent of its value while the S&amp;P 500 is down less than one percent from February 1 as of yesterday‚Äôs market close.  The stock market is supposed to be an efficient pricing mechanism. When it stops efficiently pricing risk, it loses the public‚Äôs confidence. Those invisible hands should think long and hard about that reality.  &amp;#x200B;  [S&amp;P 500 Stock Index vs Global Banks Since February 1, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/908y7ehaw8p81.jpg?width=625&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8cd4a7730fb614f583c660e7af56b4ecc91d921)

623	0	Now the US would not be lying for the first time, we all remember Powell who raised a small shit and said this is the proof that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, then invaded the country and destroyed millions of lives etc. Obviously this time is different, the army isn't going there, at the contrary they are fleeing Ukraine, but one must really wander what would be the rationale behind all this fake propaganda shit? - assuming it is indeed a fake propaganda. Indeed Ukrainian president saidast week that the US should stop pouring oil on fire, they are exaggerating, and complicating things. Russians have always denied those "histerical" allegations claiming that there is no attack whatsoever planned. People living there has a completely different opinion on the current situation.   So my question is again: - what does the US stand to win with those fake allegations? Hide inflation, justify this or that spending etc? - how to make money of that?

937	0	Hello all,  I noticed a roughly 3% increase in $MCD stock. After some DD at the drive thru, I came to the conclusion it was likely due to  their Land, Air, and Sea sandwiches; consisting of chicken, fish, and beef.   I have a Robinhood card which allows a $5000 daily limit as well a various other cards. How feasible would it be to purchase all of sandwiches everyday from each location in my area/state, causing more supplies needed to be sent to the store, and then a shortage of sandwiches at McDonalds, so really bad for their PR and thus many upset customers. I could also leave bad reviews on the Better Business Bureau website.  If I fib a little about my income on a Fidelity Visa card application, it seems like I could get a limit well over 20k. After doing this I could withdraw via cashback and transfer over to Webull who has a 4x margin short feature, and short McDonalds. So this would be 80k that will increase after bad news. Then I pay Robinhood, and Fidelity  back from the slight interest accumulated prior to the tanking.  What do you guys think? Thanks!

591	1	I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sswuta/its_not_if_but_how_much/) post last night that started a nice discussion, and thought I would try to keep the conversation going.   It seems like Vladimir Putin has decided to reopen negotiations with West. After posturing over 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border, AP reported that his military has started to pull back some of its forces. So is diplomacy in play?  While my analysis looks wrong so far, I did get one aspect correct. Putin was at a standstill and had to make a move, or risk diminishing his bargaining power. I thought Putin would take the opportunity to use aggression and force Zelensky‚Äôs hand to ultimately reject NATO. He used it to open negotiations on his terms.   I recognize that no one wants to go to war. They are expensive and often lead to unintended consequences. But Putin‚Äôs posturing shift seems to signal something else. If diplomacy is on the table, why not start with that? It could have been a miscalculation, with Putin assuming the Ukrainian comedian would quickly submit. But at the end of the day, Russia wants Ukraine independent from NATO and Ukraine wants to remain in NATO. Both of these realities cannot be true. Putin has to either admit defeat in negotiations, or invade Ukraine.   Negotiations will begin quickly, if they occur. We will know if Putin plans to keep his word within the next few days. I‚Äôm think we‚Äôll hear about a false flag attack in Belarus before that. The markets will react negatively.   Positions: SPY puts

Buy the dip is real.   But this is slightly sobering. Such reversals of more than 5% have only occurred 21 times. All have been during the tech wreck and the GFC, according to Crescat Capital.  "While most analysts predicted a sea of red would ensue all day, the market had other ideas. It closed at 13,474 ‚Äì an 886 point gain. Measured on points, it was the biggest one day move (from open to close) in the history of the Nasdaq index.   "In percentage terms, the 7% move is the seventh largest one day move (from open to close) in the Nasdaq‚Äôs history.  ‚ÄúThe last 21 times Nasdaq had an intraday reversal of over 5% happened during brutal bear markets,‚Äù says Crescat portfolio manager, Otavio Costa."  **My take - this time really different, and Costa's precedent could mean nothing.**  **Why?**   **1) There is still no alternative.

And lately, I can't even stand the face I see in the mirror. You know when youre getting older in life when gains get taken from you. That's just part of life. But, you only learn that when you start losing trades. You find out that life is just a game of inches. So is trading. Because in either game life or trading the margin for error is so small. I mean one trade too late or to early you don't quite make it. One half second too slow or too fast and you don't quite secure it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. They are in every break of the chart, every minute, every second. For WallStreetBets, we fight for that inch. We tear ourselves, and everyone around us to PIECES for that inch. We CLAW with our FINGER NAILS for that inch. Cause we know! when we add up all those gainz that's going to make the FUCKING difference between WINNING and LOSING.  Between LIVING and DYING. I'll tell you this, in any trade it is the guy who is willing to die who is going to win that trade And I know if I am going to have any life anymore it is because, I am still willing to fight, and die for that trade‚Ä¶. because that is what LIVING is. The MASSIVE GREEN DILDOS in front of your face. Now I can't make you do it. You gotta look at the retard next to you. Look into his eyes.  Now I think you are going to see somebody who will go that inch with you. You are going to see a guy who will sacrifice himself for meme stocks because he knows when it comes down to it, you are gonna do the same thing for him. That's a team, gentlemen. And either we heal now, as a team, or we will die as individuals. That's trading guys. That's all it is. Now, wtf are you gonna do?

It almost feels like 7+ Trillion bucks that FED printed are flushed down the toilet. Was it worth it, to destroy economy with printed money, if stock market was meant to crash anyway?
204	1	With The London Metals Exchange (LME) continuing their trade suspension of Nickel through tomorrow I got bored and went down a rabbit hole.   The Worlds Largest position holder in Nickel, Tsingshang Holdings Group is owned by a gentleman known in Chinese Commodity circles as the ‚ÄúBig Short‚Äù. His name Xiang Guangda. Last year in a move to collapse the price of Nickel Guangda intervened during supply chain issues in order to heighten Tsingshang‚Äôs profits and attempted the strangle hold of global Nickel markets. [SOURCE](https://www.mining.com/nickel-price-drops-most-since-2016-after-tsingshan-deal/)  We‚Äôll fast forward to this week where LME has suspended trading. In a seemingly mockery of an article the FT calls this sub out in particular [HERE](https://www.ft.com/content/1a59d601-2bdd-4d17-99ca-03f589fbf9d8) while discussing the Nickel squeeze. What is of note in the article though is that LME gave Tsingshang additional time to meet a margin call. This was done after trading was suspended and the price of Nickel went from over $100K and back tracked to just over $48K.   Not only does this seem like blatant complicity and manipulation in the commodities market, LME now once major stake holders to take ‚Äúprofits‚Äù at a extremely reduced rate. Their [Memo](https://www.lme.com/-/media/Files/News/Notices/2022/03/TRADING-22-055-NICKEL-SUSPENSION-UPDATE-CRITERIA-FOR-RESUMPTION-OF-TRADING-AND-APPLICATION-OF-PRICE.pdf) here are their guidelines to open trading back up. Pay particular attention to paragraphs 16 and 17. This is where I was dumbfounded as it‚Äôs written almost as an involuntary ‚Äúvoluntary Net-off‚Äù.  Essentially *insert pawn stars meme* best I can do is, is what they‚Äôre saying.

12	1	   First off, congrats to everyone that made bank from that price action this week. It has been a refreshing change from all of the loss porn. Even though my tits remain jacked for the rest of the week and the short term momentum, I want to discuss my thoughts on GME, why it is a great LONG play based on fundamentals, and why I think it will be the next TSLA.  First, these two companies have some essential similarities for my comparison  1. They have a huge retail following and remarkably loyal/enthusiastic investor base 2. Charismatic, passionate, and incredibly successful leaders in Cohen and Elon 3. The companies are developing new tech to be leaders in a mostly untapped market  My comparison on the fundamental side will focus on current day GME as compared to TSLA in 2017.  ........................................TSLA (2017).......... GME (today)  Market cap............................71b........................10b  Share Price.............................70...........................141  Revenue................................11b..........................6.1b  EPS.......................................-2.37......................... -5.25  Current Assets.....................6.5b.........................2.6b  Current Liabilities.................7.6b........................1.3b  Long term debt....................11.6b......................40m (yes, million)  So, looking at these numbers they are not perfect, but I think the same thing ultimately held TSLA back that will hold GME back from a fundamental perspective. This being EPS. Both companies proving to grow revenue, but not turning profit or creating cash flow. From a balance sheet perspective, GME is actually quite a bit better here with 2:1 assets:liabilities and essentially no long term debt. The cash burn for GME is a result of their investment into new streams of revenue and will hopefully start to show improvement in regard to EPS with NFT marketplace opening. This same lack of cash flow generation held back TSLA for years, but they did eventually turn positive in 2020 and guess what happened to the share price? Yep, rocket emojis.  Tesla share price went from 130 in Jan, 2020 to 793 in Jan, 2021 (adjusted price for splits)  I think long term, if you believe in the NFT marketplace as a good move for the business of GME (as I do), we could see similar price action with institutional adoption and closed short positions over time.  A couple of other things GME has working in their favor:  1. Insiders really believe. Insider buys 104k shares the last 2 days, sells 743 shares (form 4 filing) 2. Shrinking float. 76m shares - 13.6m(18% insiders) - 21.3m(28% institutions) - 10m (DRS) = **31.1m**  TLDR: GME is the next TSLA (in terms of stock performance). Once NFT marketplace starts to generate revenue and EPS turns positive we will see a TSLA-style run.  Disclosure: 343 shares at 153 average

662	0	Dear redditors,  Recently I was looking at the price of Zynga, and I noticed it was trading around 9$.  Some time ago there were rumours about 2K acquiring this stock for 9.5$ a share.  Why would the share price be lower now if it‚Äôs literally being bought at a fixed price? Its free M O N E Y.  Same goes with share corporate action buybacks, if a buyback is announced with a certain date as deadline, couldn‚Äôt you just buy a ton of shares and accept the corporate action offer? Why trade risky options if free money is dangling right in front of you?
403	1	Hi BBelievers,  A few days ago I commented on the BB Stock daily thread and it sparked some interest. I work within the cybersec industry at a large vendor and have frequent conversations with a variety of people holding roles such as CISO, Sys Admin, Network Admin, and so on. I want to cover a few things related to the current BB solution stack and how it compares to the rest of the industry.   ‚Ä¢Blackberry is 100% a competitor in the cybersec space but they continuously fall behind other vendors to secure net-new logo customers  and retain existing customers ‚Ä¢BB operates in many facets of IoT security, a niche differentiation from leading competitors that have no comparable offerings ‚Ä¢BB acquired Good Technology and more recently Cylance to augment their security offerings ‚Ä¢BB sells via Channel through SPs, ISVs, and MSSPs  All that being said, they are in a good position for growth. They are laggards when it comes to endpoint/server protection but have the potential to grow that arm of the business substantially in the near future through acquisitions and feature implementations/improvements.  Let‚Äôs examine their existing solutions and why they aren‚Äôt securing market share.  ‚Ä¢BB Protect - ML based Endpoint protection  Cylance was one of the first vendors to offer a sturdy endpoint solution integrated with ML to mitigate the risk of zero-day exploits and start the migration from signature based to signatureless based AV engines. Almost all vendors are signatureless now but haven‚Äôt deprecated the signature engine entirely as it still serves a function in identifying previously utilized attack methods.  The agent has a small footprint with a comparable resource draw to other vendors but their level of protection is fairly narrow and not reliable as they do not regularly participate in 3rd party validation tests. The deployment can be lengthy and for larger companies that is a tremendous drawback. Check out Gartner, AV-Test, and Forrester Wave.  Machine learning is a buzzword nowadays. In the context of cybersecurity it is utilized to detect not previously seen attacks, unknown malware, and potentially unwanted applications. BB ML comes with a high false positive rate and more work needs to be done to win businesses over. Their Anti-malware, ransomware, and exploit protection is not comprehensive with many common features missing.   BB Optics - EDR/XDR threat hunting tools  These tools have become commonplace after compliance/insurance requirements. In short, they allow a company to run queries on their security telemetry that‚Äôs stored on disk or on the cloud. Queries are run to identify vulnerabilities and threats so you can then take action to remediate. BB has limited XDR and lacks the capabilities to remediate threats effectively for a company‚Äôs SOC. Isolation and remote command line access are necessary features of EDR and BB doesn‚Äôt stack up.  BB Guard - MDR/IR/SOC as a Service   Incident response/MDR is a game changer for companies without the bandwidth to hunt and remediate threats by themselves. BB does not have a fully managed SOC offering to remediate, their focus is detection and triaging.  If they build up a heftier SOC and offer remediation/IR they can convert IR customers to long-term Guard Advanced.  Their server protection is basically non existent so I won‚Äôt cover it. If they want to grow, it requires a full stack offering to create heavily invested customers. It‚Äôs a hassle to manage numerous management consoles and configure the plethora of policies between them.   Real potential is seen with their QNX hypervisor and IVY. Data is the new oil and they are set to cash in. They are the #1 automotive embedded OS and have cornered the OEM market. RTOS - real time operating systems will grow correspondingly with EV/AI self-driving adoption. This could be hindered by component shortages, global logistics going down the drain, and resource shortages stemming from events such as the invasion of Ukraine and their stranglehold on the worlds semiconductor grade neon.  Blackberry will not and should not ever become the next Crowdstrike, Sentinelone, or Sophos. They should remain on course to takeover the IoT world and introduce EV data telemetry like we‚Äôve never seen before. The moment a snowflake rolls down a hill it has no choice but to grow and expand to a snowball. I see BB capitalizing on this relatively new industry and becoming a massive snowball crushing and integrating all the other snowballs in its path down this EV hill.  There is a huge focus on John Chen but we need to look at those who actively manage the company and not just the figurehead.  ‚Ä¢John Giametto - President BB Cyber (Previously McAfee President/CRO)  ‚Ä¢Mattias Eriksson - President BB IoT Mattias is the real driver of QNX/IVY success  ‚Ä¢Mark Wilson - CMO Long term CMO, need his team to pump some life into BB and make it a household name no longer synonymous with phones  ‚Ä¢Nita White-Ivy - CHRO Nita leads HR and BB has had significant employee growth count under her leadership. BB is rapidly expanding sales/engineering head count to lock in additional sales revenue across the board  I hold 7,500 long shares and plan to increase my position to 10-15,000 shares gradually across the year. Compare BB to CRWD for fun. $38 billion difference in market cap, nearly identical EPS, and nearly identical float. BB financials stack up well except for one important metric‚Ä¶growth! BB has stagnated and is priced in correspondingly based off their prior and expected growth. CRWD is priced in based off their rapid growth. If BB puts up the growth analysts want to see then the moon is ours.  To summarize, $BB $500 by EoY

629	1	Okay so, I see a lot of posts of peoples opinions and thinking that the bull run isn‚Äôt over etc. and providing there own opinions on it.  I personally do not see a bull run at all. I see maybe certain trends and moments of momentum here and there but no bull run.  This is now going to be an institutional prop up game. Institutions now more so than ever, will be motivated to prop up stocks and essentially rug pull, $FB style when the time is right.  Doesn‚Äôt mean FDs are done, fuck the world could be going through an apocalypse and FDs will always remain relevant.  But, this is now time to go back and focus on real DD and stocks where their business and business models are profitable, cash positive, have low debt, etc.   This will soon be a market where if your bag holding really bad companies, you‚Äôll be bag holding far longer then you think.  TL;DR - There will not be massive on-going bull runs. Maybe some momentum trends here and there, but as a whole, the real and realistic DD and smart plays involving sound companies can go a long way here, including FDs.  The markets will eventually need to correct itself naturally due to the state of its economy. This is inevitable, we are just putting blankets and band-aids on it atm and playing willful blindness to the actual current state of our economies.  I will say, it really does depend how quickly the world acts on removing restrictions and mandates and getting the economy back up and running at full capacity. This is a very crucial component the has continuously been ignored by governments.

315	0	In case you‚Äôve been confused by media stories that Ukraine might actually beat back Russia, those are all storylines with zero merit.  When applied worldwide (across all NATO countries in unison) as they‚Äôve been, they‚Äôre designed to demoralize the Russians, embolden the Ukrainians, garner public support/backlash, diminish Russian public support for Putin, etc etc etc.   The Russians didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrun out of gas‚Äù They aren‚Äôt crying to mommy on the Internet.  They aren‚Äôt worried Putin is losing sanity (they love him).   It‚Äôs just so comical that people believe they‚Äôre watching actual news.   We (America &amp; NATO) are SACRIFICING the Ukrainians to diminish Putin (if we can). That‚Äôs how much our leaders care about Ukrainians and Ukraine.   Sad.   As for trading- oil prices will continue higher. And markets probably lower.  I‚Äôm still expecting SPY easily sub 400 before this downdraft has run its course.   Best of luck to all both long and short

Is PLTR seriously undervalued right now, or is it really going to be 2-3 dollars in another few months?

You and me both know that Musky is an absolute loose cannon when he sits on the toilet with his phone. One could literally imagine anything under the sun breaking securities laws, telling a sitting U.S. Senator he looks like he came, and criticizing the government heavily. However, it is interesting to note that Musk hardly ever mentions China in almost any negative light. It's almost as if a majority of his production relies on the whims of an image obsessed regime.   It is well known that to gain access to the profit laden Chinese market you sacrifice your first born sons left nut and every ounce of intellectual property. The intellectual property that isn't handed over willingly is probably just stolen too. Now there is one thing that China loves more then stealing other peoples intellectual property, and that is creating near knockoffs with that intellectual property.   I mean look at what happened to Jack Ma, he mentions the whip of reform then just falls off the side of the map, when questioned the CCP told you he went away on a vacation lol. By happenstance, if Musk unleashes those twitter fingers on anything and I mean anything that remotely offends Xi or the CCP it could ignite hell. If Tesla even has a chance to sell 118% of the cars on the planet, the Chinese market is going to be key.  \-Complete speculation, but in my üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª wet dream I foresee a reality where Musk grows huge balls and makes a Winnie the Pooh and Xi reference just for the memes  Just like everything in China, the promise of massive short term profit increase is guranteed, but sets an ominous long term tone.

905	1	I know this isn't r/investing and things like P/E ratios don't matter here. But, seeing some of you crayon eaters discuss the impact of rate hikes has given me cancer and AIDS at the same time so I want to help you help me:  List of things that AREN'T going to crash the market:  * People flocking to bonds for a 2% yield * Increased borrowing costs * Higher production costs  List of things that ARE going to crash the market:  * VALUATIONS  The gold standard for valuing a business is the Discounted Cash Flow model (DCF). In this model, a business's future cash flows are forecasted and the discounted or present value of those future cash flows is the value of the business. The key component of this model is the discount rate, or weighted average cost of capital (WACC).   Every single 23 year old Ivy League schmuck Wall St. analyst starts with the risk free rate, or the treasury bond yields, for their WACC. That is the interest rate that JPow is playing around with. Then they add a few other things that aren't relevant here, but they all have the same inputs.  What happens when the discount rate goes up? Chad plugs the new rate into his DCF model and the valuation goes down. His bank lowers their price target and people dump the stock.   Nobody is safe from this, but our favorite stocks are most sensitive to interest rates. That explains why you're all down 80%+ when SPY hasn't even entered a correction. Why? Because most tech companies' long term cash flow forecasts are based on a wink and a nod, "we'll get profitable in 10 years when we've achieved scale". The extra 10 years of discounting make those cash flows worthless outside of a zero interest rate environment (if they were ever going to happen at all).  Now for the love of god go sell everything you own and buy puts.

So before we dive into the billion dollar profit scenario of aTesla app, lets look first at the billion dollar profit example of the Apple App store.  Unvealed nearly 15 years ago now, the Apple app store has changed the way we interact with out phones permanently. With the click of a button users can now install Netflix to watch their favourite shows, install productivity applications to help with work or even purchase games to keep you entertained whilst you sit in the bus, train or even‚Ä¶. your car. (See where I‚Äôm going with this?). The Apple app store has long been a core component of Apples growth. **Doing nearly $90 billion in revenue per year** which is nearly equal to the total revenue generated by companies like UPS, Target and Johnson &amp; Johnson. So how does this money-printing machine actually work?  **‚úì**  Apple has different revenue splits with their developers based on the TYPE of subscription/purchase. In the 2021 during the court-case against Fortnite maker Epic Games, Apple *was* willing to say in the courtroom that Apples commission, the rate that it charges developers to host an app on its store, has declined over time.  &gt;‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs 30% commission does not apply to everyone, and 85% of the apps are free, with no commission‚Äù Cook said.  Ok, but what fee *actually* applies for *what* type of purchase? Let‚Äôs break it down quickly. There are 4 main comissions that apple takes:  1. 30% of all one-time payments  The Apps that make the most money on the app store tend to be video-games which aren't subscription based purchases and thus because these are one-time purchases Apple colects 30% of the revenue.  2. 15% of subscription based payments  Apple *only* takes 15% of the payment if there is a subscription involved. Apple takes 30% off the first subscription payment and then collects 15% of all payments afterwards until the subscription is cancelled (if it is cancelled)  3.Purchases outside the app-store.  Apple takes no Revenue from apps where the purchases/subscriptions happens outside of the App store. For example, you purchase a Netflix subscription via the internet, not the app store.  4. Free applications  Lastly we have Free apps which account for 84% of all available apps, So Apple receives no comission from supporting, hosting, and distributing these apps as no payments occur in these apps so ofcourse Apple takes no comission.  # Given this information we now have a better understanding of how the Tesla app store could function with regards to revenue. So now that you‚Äôve passed the course on, ‚ÄúWTF is the Apple app store‚Äú let‚Äôs go to the next topic and confirm the legitimacy and accuracy of the recent breaking Tesla-App store news..  # Why the Tesla App Store rumours are legitimate.. üß™  The updated news that Tesla may be launching an App store was sparked multiple times in 2020, 2021 and even earlier in January this year. However this time it is different, the the recently rumoured news that Tesla may be launching an appstore of its own gained significant traction late sunday night, when multiple respected accounts confirmed , that *they too* had heard, the rumour that a Tesla app store is coming soon. This all started after [u/Teslascope](https://www.reddit.com/u/Teslascope/) on twitter released the following statement:  [https://twitter.com/teslafolder/status/1490611334630809600?s=20&amp;t=FuW1GMMfW7ZHZZQDa3l\_qQ](https://twitter.com/teslafolder/status/1490611334630809600?s=20&amp;t=FuW1GMMfW7ZHZZQDa3l_qQ)  In subsequent tweets, it was mentioned by Teslascope, that;  &gt;‚ÄúThe anticipated release was this year around Q3, although should be fully baked before deliveries of Cybertruck. Been in the works for almost a year now.‚Äù  This is reinforced by a leaked patent Tesla had applied for regarding the Cybertruck, in which there appears to be some functionality similar to an App-store feature.  Interestingly enough this leak appears to be backed up by the fact that there is literally a Tesla App store website page *(apps.tesla.com*\*\*)\*\* which mysteriously you cannot log into *yet*, but the page clearly shows a warning that states download to use ‚ÄòTesla Apps‚Äô.  üì∑  These facts all seem to point towards the obvious release of a Tesla App store, but the question you are asking is when will it be released?  I asked respected Tesla Investor [Sawyerr Merrit](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt) about the validity of these rumours and when we may expect a Tesla app store to be launched and he said;  &gt;‚ÄúAgain, the rumor is just that, a rumor, but I do think **Tesla launching an app store of their own makes sense** and is a natural step forward for the company. I don‚Äôt expect it this quarter or even the next. My guess is we would probably be looking at late 2022 at the earliest.‚Äù  This would align with Tesla‚Äôs 2022 ‚Äúproduct-roadmap‚Äú update in which Elon musk repeatedly mentioned that 2022 will be the year of software. In the recent Q4 earnings call he stated multiple times that  &gt;‚ÄúEverything pales in comparison to the value of a robotaxi or full self-driving,‚Äù When Level 4 Autonomy is reached, you‚Äôre going from an asset that has a utility of 12 hours per week as a passenger car ‚Äúto maybe around 50 or 60 hours a week, so a (five times) increase in the utlity of the asset‚Äù Musk said.  We know Elon is super bullish on FSD, so with Saywer‚Äôs estimate about a Tesla launch in late 2022 this would allign well with the continious improvements we‚Äôve been seeing with FSD as we approach full self driving vehicles in the near-future.  &gt;[Twitter user StatsTeslaApp ](https://www.maadotaa.com/)believes that Tesla will allow ‚Äúthird-party developers to create apps that show up alongside current apps that are provided by Tesla (eg, Spotify, Tidal, messages, etc). For example, some of the functionalities included in apps like (the) Stats app for Tesla which is currently (only available) for iOS/iPadOS can be ported to an app in (the) Tesla App Store. For instance, the battery health functionality of Stats app is a good candidate.‚Äú  The possibilities for a Tesla app store are endless. Now let‚Äôs look at‚Ä¶  Let‚Äôs now look at **how** the Tesla software and apps are currently integrated, and how they actually already have some sort of subscription that could paint the picture of how a future Tesla app store may work and how *much money* that will generate‚Ä¶  # How Tesla‚Äôs current software works¬†  Currently the functionality of the Tesla touch-screen display **is far from its potential.** At the moment you have the driver features, such as being able to map out your journey, see where super-chargers are located you also have limited games available and apps like Netflix and spotify available. Interestingly enough, Tesla themselves have to adapt these apps as there isn‚Äôt any public developer kit for companies to port their apps to the Tesla system. This would need to be changed in the future if an App store would be introduced, and the difficulty of creating this is potentially one of the reasons an app store hasn‚Äôt been released yet. So at the moment the Tesla apps are great and fun but not yet the ground-breaking profit machine it will become.  Currently there are nearly 3 million Tesla vehicles on the road, by the end of 2022 that number will approach 4.5 million *(Assuming 1,5million vehicles delivered).* Why is the number of Tesla‚Äôs on the road important?  Elon musk explained this quite succinctly on the lightning podcast in 2019, keep in mind at the time Tesla had less than a million vehicles on the road.  &gt;‚ÄúIn order for it to be worthwile for somebody *(a company)* to write *(develop)* an app, there has to be enough of an install base *(userbase)* to warrant the effort. Even if you are going to port something, it's still got to be worth the effort. As our number of vehicles grow, it starts to potentially make more sense to develop games and other applications for Tesla. **We just need** ***a lot*** **of cars.**‚Äù  Tesla ofcourse doesn‚Äôt need the app store, but introducing the app store would produce Apple like profits and increase Tesla‚Äôs already strong moat. You can bet that legacy automakers who are struggling to replicate Tesla‚Äôs success with EV‚Äôs will similarly struggle to introduce an app store. Remember, Tesla is a tech company. A Tesla app store becomes just another one of the 100 selling points for the Tesla brand, whilst strengthening the Tesla ecosystem.  &amp;#x200B;  It is important for you to know that Tesla already has alot of functionality in their display compared to competitors. You can play graphically intense games like The Witcher on a Tesla but not its competitors.  &gt;Sawyer Merrit believes that ‚ÄúI would expect them to develop and release their own apps on the app store. They are developing so many things in house. In terms of what apps Tesla could create, I think it would be a brand spectrum from games, maybe safety tracking, fun car quirks, subscription based apps, etc.‚Äù  &amp;#x200B;  Funnily enough Tesla are actually already providing alot of functionality *for only $10* a month with their Premium Connectivity subscription that you can purchase. **So what** **is this subscription and what does it mean for a Tesla app store?**  # Premium Connectivity - A sign of things to come?üì∑  Tesla already provides many features that help set-up their ability to create an app store. Late in 2020 Tesla launched Premium Vehicle connectivity. *It allows users to stream music or videos, to browse the internet or to see live traffic.* This feature is often overlooked, it is a strong source of powerful recurring revenue and is one of the many ways Tesla is increasing the potential revenue of their vehicles. Tesla has introduced this feature such that the company can offer similar services ot its customers. Tesla already has entertainment with Tesla theater and Tesla arcade which could become very similar to Apple TV+ and Apple arcade. This Premium Connectivity package provides alot of features you might envision are already "apps" on the Tesla system.  Currently with the Premium Connectivity you get access to the following features  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla can either introduce similar features and sell them seperately on their app store, or they can increase the pricing of these features. Again Sawyerr Merrit is kind enough to share his thoughts, believing that Tesla will increase subscription costs;  &gt;‚ÄúPrice(s) will likely go up as the feature list and functionality increases. As more features become available, they (Tesla) could have various subscription tiers so people can choose the features they want instead of having to pay for everything or get nothing. Subscription based things will likely bring a lot of revenue in for Tesla. This is a model Apple has been adopting for years, and it has been very successful.¬†  The already existing subscriptions such as FullSelfDriving (FSD) or the previously mentioned Premium Connectivity subscriptions provide a great foundation point for Tesla to introduce more features, in the future these subscriptions may all be managed through the Tesla App store. But, OK, how would a Tesla app store look like? Function? How much money would it generate? **Let me answer those 2 important questions‚Ä¶.**  # How the Tesla App Store will work  In the not-to-distant future, Tesla‚Äôs will be driving themselves. When this happens, a Tesla app store will mean Tesla does less work creating application integrations themselves, has more applications to offer users, will earn significant comission on in-Tesla-app purchases and will generate a win-win-win scenario, a win for Tesla, the consumer and the app developers.  There are some problems with the current Tesla software that a Tesla App store could address and fix, namely the fact that currently the spotify version in a Tesla is missing features compared to the online version of Spotify. Tesla has to put in work to integrate these music streaming services and must manually port games like the witcher to their vehicles. By opening up their Software Developer Kit (SDK) to developers, the experience will improve greatly for users as developers will make the apps themselves. Thus, for example, Spotify can have a dedicated team for Spotfiy in Tesla, Tesla approves the app and the overall experience thus increases. With the possibility of an FSD future, we know that these developers will definitely want to create Tesla versions of their apps. Tesla could also introduce and allow paid applications such as games, productivity apps or a screen-mirroring app or even stock-trading apps your Tesla will virtually become a moving smart phone.  The interest for developers to create apps is already really large. Twitter user [StatsTeslaApp ](https://twitter.com/StatsTeslaApp)who is the developer of the famous Tesla Statistics said he was interested in developing a portable version of his Tesla Stats App, he said "  &gt;‚ÄúMost likely, yes (I would create a Tesla version of the app). All the statistics shown in the Stats app (eg, efficiency, phantom drain, battery health, battery capacity, etc) are good candidates for the Tesla AppStore‚Äú  Specifically, the features StatsTeslaApp believes to be the most important to make the app store useful and viable are such that;  &gt;‚ÄúTesla should provide access to the current Tesla API and it would be great if Tesla can also provide access to some of the information that is currently provided only on the CAN bus (eg, battery temperature and battery voltage)‚Äù  Now ofcourse, there is severely limited capability of the Tesla App store, IF, Full-Self-Driving isn‚Äôt achieved. The Average American spends about 1 hour per day driving their car. **That is about 6% of your day** assuming you sleep 8 hours. Now without FSD the Tesla app store becomes much less important, as you simply will be using it less. Currently the Tesla Apps are nearly all used when the car is idle or stopped, or for the people (children most likely) in the rear seats. If FSD is achieved the use of Tesla Software and Apps increases dramatically, and so thus would the demand for Tesla apps. A 10 hour car journey instead of being tedious, becomes a 5 hour Netflix session and 5 hours of work and zoom calls, the productivity and usage of the car changes dramatically. Currently the Tesla FSD software is priced at $12,000, Sawyerr Merrit shares his thoughts on the future pricing of FSD.  &gt;‚ÄúI think for now Tesla will stick with its $2k price increase increments at a time, so maybe $14k by late this year (2022) or early next year potentially. Eventually I could ***see FSD as a whole costing tens of thousands.*** it will be the main feature of the car. I think it will become so useful and increase safety quite a bit to where you wouldn‚Äôt want to buy a car without it‚Äù  If this ends up being the case, you can imagine the value of the Tesla App store will be significant because of that 1 hour everyday in which you no longer need to pay attention to the road and can focus on other things, like entertainment or work.  Speaking about the value of the Tesla App store, let‚Äôs jump into some projections on the true financial potential of a Tesla app store by 2**025. The math is shocking‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.**  # The Maths - The Value of the Tesla App Store  Obviously this section wil not be 100% accurate, but it will provide you with a phenomenal understanding of the implications that FSD and a Tesla App store would have for the company. For this section we will not look at the value of FSD but instead at the value of a Tesla-App store, assuming that Level 4 Autonomy has been reached. (So again, that 1 hour of driving everyday frees up time for entertainment or productivity)  The Apple-App-store generates alot of revenue, partially because the Iphone has billions of users. So we must *first* look at and project the amount of Tesla‚Äôs on the road in 2025. In 2025 Tesla will have **sold** a cumulative of 10.6 million vehicles assuming 35% YoY growth. *(Note, Tesla is likely to hit 50% YoY growth so this is slightly pessimistic).*  According to multiple sources, Apple generates, per user, a revenue of about $138 via Apple app store purchases/subscription comission in 2019. The Average purchase price (cost of the average transaction) is about $0.80 cents on the app store. Tesla can already run and offer users to play games like *The Witcher* which costs about $34 usd at the moment on PC.  So we already know that Tesla will be able to offer more intese applications so the average purchasing price, or cost of the average transaction, on The Tesla App store will be significantly higher than that of the App store. The most popular bought game on the App-store is Minecraft which costs $7 to install. That is thus 8.75 times the average App-store transaction. So for our Tesla example we are safe to assume that given the average price of a paid application (like Minecraft), that it will be proportionate to be about 8.75 times more expensive than the average Tesla app store transaction. Minecraft on the PC costs about $27, so **about 4 times as expensive** as on the iPhone.  Now, this is a HUGE assumption but, we now assume that the average amount spent per year on the Tesla-App-Store per user, will thus also be 4 times the average amount spent per user in the Apple App store, so:  Average amount spent per year on Tesla Appstore  *Average amount spent in the Apple App store in 2019 by paying customers) \** (4) = The Average Amount spent in the Tesla App store  Which is:  138 \* 4 = $552 per year  *\[Ignore this if you‚Äôre reading online.* ***If you‚Äôve received this article via email,*** *please visit the online version to view the entire article, due to the length of this in-depth article the final 1/4 can only be viewed online\]*  $552 per year doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable as we know that owning an EV saves users hundreds of dollars per year on gas, so the $552 per year doesn‚Äôt seem crazy. Especially if the purchase of a video game through the Tesla-app store carries over to your other accounts like on your computer or playstation. Ok, so we now know the average amount spent per year on Tesla apps per average paying user. Now it is important to know *that only about 5% of Apple users spend money on the app store*. Now because I believe the Tesla app store will simply have so much more functionality, more games, better games, more features for work, relaxation and productivity. I can almost guarantee that more Tesla users will spend money on the Tesla app store compared to to the Apple app store. We can look at the current $10 monthly Premium connectivity subscription as an example for what the take-rate might be for users paying in the app store. Twitter user StatsTeslaApp believes that;  &gt;‚ÄúI do not have numbers based on any measurement, but I would guess is more than 80% (of Tesla owners have bought the Premium Connectivity‚Äù  Similarly we can look at the current amount of FSD users, and as Sawyerr Merrit explains the current % of Tesla users who have purchased FSD (remember it costs now $12,000!) is 7.3%.  &gt;‚ÄúThere really isn‚Äôt any firm data on what the take rate is for PC (Premium Connectivity). It‚Äôs certainly significantly higher than the FSD take rate though, which is estimated to be 7.3% globally (based on [@TroyTeslike](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike) estimates). As the feature list grows though, more people will subscribe.‚Äù  This is insane, Tesla FSD costs significantly more than an app store purchase, and already it is estimated that 7% of Tesla users have bought/subscribed to FSD. Thus in our assumption we will assume that 60% of all Tesla vehicles will partake in the Tesla App store.  By 2025, there will be, as previously mentioned, baout 10.6 million Tesla‚Äôs on the road. So 60% would equate to about 6.36 million Tesla vehicles.  Using this number, we now know how many users will spend money in the app store, and we previously already calculated that the Average amount spent in the App-store by users will be roughly $552 per year. So we can now calculate the amount of revenue per year that a Tesla app store would generate in 2025 and beyond.  2025 App store revenue = 552\*6,360,000  Thus using these numbers, **I estimate it is possible that in 2025 a Tesla App store generates‚Ä¶..**  # Tesla App Store generates $3.51 billion in 2025  **$3.51** billion per year. Of which, (using 78% profit margins) **$2.738 billion is pure profit**.  This would provide a value of 2,738,000,000 / 1,033,507,611\* = $2.64 per share in profit, using a P/E ratio of 50 that means a Tesla App store could be worth $132 per share in 2025. *(\* note, As of January 31st, 2022 there are a total of* ***1,033,507,611*** *shares outstanding of Tesla stock. )*  Profit and Revenue projections (The final formula)  0.6 \*   *(Cumulative number of Tesla vehicles sold*)\*(552) = Revenue generated per year from the Tesla App store.  You can extrapolate this estimate into the future, you can see in the diagram below that again given the 35% YoY growth and the previous assumptions. You see here the data for Tesla App store revenue and profit per year.  &amp;#x200B;  You can see from the graph above that **the estimates are staggering**. And after having read this article you should be able to see the insane potential of the Tesla App store, and why the recent rumours are so promising! Now let me summarize for you the‚Ä¶  **TLDR**  ‚öôTesla is currently working on their own App store.  ü§ëThe Apple-App store currently generates $66.3 billion in profit per year.  üëîWith FSD, the Average american will have 1 hour to work/relax extra per day, time they don't have to spend driving anymore. This will increase productivity to new levels in the economy.  üìàTesla App store could generate $13.5 billion in profit by 2030.  ===  Thankyou for reading!

The charting software plots the moving average as a line directly into the price chart.  Currently Relative Strength Index (RSI-14) reading of stock is 18.5. RSI reading varies between 0 and 100. Speed and change of stock price movement is measured by the RSI momentum oscillator. J. Welles Wilder developed Relative Strength Index (RSI) that is used most commonly as momentum indicator. Commonly when RSI goes below 30 then stock is overload and stock is overbought when it goes above 70. 30 to 70 are considered a normal reading of a stock. General trend, finding deviations and failure swings can be detected by using RSI.  **VOLATILITY ANALYSIS:**  Volatility remained at 27.83% over last week and shows 20.24% volatility in last month. Market risk that established with market trade and it is measured by beta factor. Beta indicator lies at 2.43. Risk is measured on the beta factor, if beta is higher than 1 then risk is higher and if beta is lower than 1, then risk will be low. VOLATILITY is also measured by ATR an exponential moving average (14-days) of the True Ranges. ATR value stands at 0.28.  **PROFITABILITY SNAP:**  Return on Assets (ROA) shows that the company is profitable as compared to its total assets which is -265.40%.

755	1	Everything going on with Peloton recently is suspicious. They released preliminary quarterly results on January 20th via their investor relation page which only gave us a peek into their coming up short on expectations. The stock tanked 25% subsequently.   Then we conviently get rumors about a possible acquisition after their preliminary report and the stock reclaimed the initial 25% drop.   What this tells me is that their earnings are going to be horrible and they wanted to mitigate the blow the full earnings report will have on their stock price by having the price hit come in two waves with a pump in-between based on nothing but a maybe. We're witnessing some serious grasping and manipulation from a dying company trying to stay afloat.   I predict we're going to see Peloton tank hard tomorrow on earnings after market close from not only a huge miss on EPS/revenue and declining subscriptions, but also from no further concrete acquisition news considering no savy suitors would buy an unprofitable company at their current overbloated valuation.   What are your thoughts?  Link to their preliminary report: https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-reports-preliminary-second-quarter/

First if you turn the ticker upside down and backwards you get VAVS which is obviously a mispelling of VANS which people haven't been driving for years due to an uptick in the SUV market.   Also I have never heard of SAVA until today and am pretty sure it was just made up by the Canadian trucker blockade to distract us from the fact that no one ever talks about clear Dr. Pepper anymore.   I did a google search of clear Dr. Pepper and came up with this image (worth approximately 31 million in today's market if you own the original link). Obviously this man has never worked at SAVA or even heard of this company and is in desperate need of a day off.  TLDR: SAVA is just a bunch of guys in vans with really bad satellite internet drinking regular Dr. Pepper.

With the hope it will bounce to an [ATH ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSX-ATH/) or intermonth ATH between now and March 4th.  Aside from accumulating and holding calls for the next 20-30 days, we will re-enter the "19th" thesis at our next either [ATH ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSX-ATH/)($48x+) or Inter-month / quarterly high ($458).

375	1	It feels like a gem that was shorted into the rough. I mean it did 150% today but the chart is still bullish as hell. It traded 27x the 22M free float today so there was clearly wash trading happening.   Mullen Automotive is either a too good to be true or a robbery, but that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for for right?   It‚Äôs EV car company and released updates on production time frames today.   It appears to be a perfect set up for a buy out since their batteries are projected to do 600 miles fully charged. Also there was a stock offering from partners which could be a condition of the potential purchaser.  Short interest is high and likely naked. It also had a current market cap of 59 million. With the right amount of hype this could be the biggest mover of 2022.   I got 100 2.5 calls for March and a couple hundred shares for long term. Not financial advice
177	0	Hey!  I did not buy nor plan to buy their rubbles. However, looking at the graph, it kinda keeps "jumping" up and down. It is still way worse than it used to be, but I wonder what causes these jumps?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!
680	1	Before you grab your pitchforks and get your panties in a knot because I said the words "short squeeze", let me say this isn't a 'get-rich-quick sHoRt SqUeEzE to the moon' post. This is DATA and FACTS.  According to the latest Yahoo Finance data update, about 13% of TLRY‚Äôs float is being shorted.   While that float probably isn‚Äôt high enough for a major short squeeze, any short interest above 10% is generally considered elevated. That should raise warnings on BOTH sides; bulls should be concerned about underlying fundamentals, while bears should be concerned about the possibility of a squeeze if short interest continues to increase.  The already heavily-shorted stock has seen even more interest from short sellers as of late, despite its profitable fiscal Q2 earnings surpassing Wall Street‚Äôs earnings estimates, and Tilray's feat of reporting positive EBITDA for the 11th consecutive quarter.  Just keep this stock in the back pocket of your watch list and please comment, even if you're of the opposite opinion.    *DISCLAIMER: This is not investment advice. DYOR.

The context being, after hours trading and news had just landed that Russia had invaded Ukraine.      Next thing we know SPY surges.      What I'm getting from this is no one has any clue how news will impact a market, it's a woozy it's a wazzzy it's all blown out the kazooo and this is a casino.      Anyone got proof to dispute this fact and say that day trading is possible?

Given the bearish sentiment, if zillow actually did semi decent and pulled their retarded heads out of their asses, could this be a good bet to the upside?   Gay bears expect bad earnings + stock down 70 percent in the past year + shit earnings last time as well as shit guidance = big potential up if they did not get fucked.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the cabinet also had two days to come up with a list of commodities covered by the ban. (Corrected on March 8)    &gt;   &gt;The decree came hours after President Biden said that the U.S. would [ban imports of Russian oil](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-planning-to-ban-russian-oil-imports-11646746787?mod=article_inline) over the country‚Äôs [invasion of Ukraine](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news?mod=article_inline) and the European Union said it would aim to cut imports of Russian natural gas by two-thirds this year. The U.K. government also said Tuesday it was phasing out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 and is exploring options to end Russian gas imports altogether.   &gt;   &gt;Russia is the third-largest oil producer in the world and the biggest exporter of natural gas. The exports fuel Russia‚Äôs economy and the West was believed to be [too dependent on them](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-does-the-u-s-still-buy-russian-oil-11646151935?mod=article_inline) to quit easily. The invasion of Ukraine changed that dynamic.   &gt;   &gt;Oil prices rose following Mr. Putin‚Äôs decree. Brent-crude prices, the international benchmark, extended earlier gains to trade 5.9% higher at $130.50 a barrel, before slipping back. They remained below the high of about $139 a barrel recorded on Monday.   &gt;   &gt;Russia is also a major supplier of grains and metals such as aluminum, nickel and palladium. A sweeping ban on exports could upend global commodity markets. Nickel hit an all-time high today.   &gt;   &gt;The decree was a follow-up to earlier measures taken by the Kremlin in retaliation for Western sanctions. It described the goal of the commodity-export ban as ‚Äúensuring the security of the Russian Federation and the uninterrupted functioning of industry.‚Äù The ban will be in effect until Dec. 31, according to the decree.   &gt;   &gt; *‚ÄîJoe Wallace contributed to this article.*   &amp;#x200B;  Bonus Content   twitter(dot)com/InvestorTurf/status/1501188485444743170  InvestorTurf Tweets:  &gt;Melvin Capital‚Äôs Gabe Plotkin was reportedly short $100 million worth of nickel shortly before the price rallied 250%.

849	1	WSB wants more DD? Then say no more. PGR is an insurance company that has millions of policies in force but which faced strong headwinds the last few months/year; headwinds which will continue into the foreseeable future.   **TL DR:** costs of claims are going up and inflation is making sure they aren't coming down any time soon.  &amp;#x200B;  1. **This is strictly an earnings play (quick adventure Morty, in and out!)**    1. PGR is by all measures a well run company whose stock appreciation over time speaks for itself.     2. With time, there's no reason to think that they can't continue to perform well in whatever market conditions their.     3. For now, increased costs in the insurance business due to inflationary pressure is real and it's going to hurt the bottom line.     4. Their earnings in a couple of weeks could very well miss expectations and their forward guidance for 2022 may not be strong. If this turns out to be true, look for a pull back on their stock price. 2. **What PGR insures**    1. Auto/vehicles and property 3. **What's impacting the costs involved in their business?**     1. 2020 is gone and people are out and about and driving more. More driving means more accidents. More accidents is bad for business.        1. Accidents cause costs to rise through vehicle repairs.        2. Costs in providing rentals go up.       3. Costs in paying for injuries go up.     2. On the property side, hurricanes like IDA and other massive storms cause significant losses and cost increase to PGR. And they aren't getting better. Things like climate change which can make storms more frequent or sever are only going to get worse based on what climate change science is telling us.    3. On top of that, inflation is hitting this business bad.        1. Vehicles are significantly more expensive and continuing to rise in costs.        2. Parts for fixing vehicles are more expensive and oh guess what? These parts aren't even here half the time because of shipping delays and supply issues.        3. If parts are delayed that means that people need more time in rental vehicles which means more $$$ being shelled out by PGR.        4. And hurricanes like Hurricane IDA and other weather related issues aren't making things any better. Everyone on this sub knows how expensive housing material has become and inflation in that industry is just as bad as are supply chain issues.     4. Wage inflation is also going to be contributing to their costs. Grocery bills have skyrocketed and wages will be increased to some extent to account for that.  4. **Okay so expenses are through the roof, but where are we with current valuations and how do they compare to peers?**     1. PE/Market Cap(Billions)/Revenue(Billions)       1. PGR 19.3/64.1/47.7       2. TRV 11.9/41.5/34.8       3. CB 10.5/86.3/40 round about from prior 4 quarters       4. ALL 10.9/34.9/50.6    2. PGR clearly has a premium on their peers which in prior years was deserved due to better business execution. But given the current environment I don't think it's going to be justified.  5. **Back to Costs, Are they going to be profitable?**     1. Almost assuredly, but less so than expected.     2. They measure their profitability based on their underwriting margin. Anything less then 100% means that they were profitable.     3. The last 3 months of 2021 their ratio consisted of (Oct/Nov/Dec) 97.2, 91.9, 94.6. Compare that to the same Q in 2019 (nobody drove in 2020 so that's going to be an outlier of profitability) 94, 94.1, 89.4. All but one month is significantly higher.  6. **What about earnings?**    1. Comparing the 10Q from 2019 and 2021 for the first 9 months of each year we see that net income (billions) was 2,899.5 in 2019 and 2,388.6 in 2021.     2. One more thing to think about in earnings is how well have their investments done? Insurance companies invest extra money they get from policy holders that doesn't get paid out. With the volatility in this market, it's completely possible they made misses or just went low volatility and lost gains. This will also potentially impact their earnings negatively.  7. **Costs are up, net income is lower now than it was two years ago, these trends are likely to persist going forward.**  8. **Price Targets**    1. I'll let the pros give that to you, I'm not going to pretend like I know what I'm doing here.  9. **What could go wrong?**    1. Everything.     2. Management has shown in the past they can execute well and it's entirely possible they over perform and give strong guidance for 2022.     3. Their CEO is arguably one of the best.     4. As Heisenberg says, "tread lightly"  &amp;#x200B;  3/18 100 P  3/18 105 P  &amp;#x200B;  You can find all of this info through their 10q and 8k forms published on their website. You should probably read through their earnings publications as well, lot's of good info in there.

952	1	According to the latest short interest data from Nasdaq there are about 27,000,000 shares sold short. According to yahoo data the percentage of float sold short is 66.18%. This would mean that there is approximately 41,000,000 shares in the total float(available to be bought and sold). In the last earnings call, CEO Mark Tritton said they have $265,000,000 remaining of buyback which is to be concluded by the end of their fiscal year (end of February). The average share price since then has been $14 would equal about 19,000,000 shares being bought back. This means after the buyback is complete the float will now be roughly 22 million shares. With nearly 27 million shares sold short, we will have a short interest of over 122%, similar to GME before it squeezed. (Float is different then shares outstanding, float is shares available to be bought and sold and shares outstanding includes shares owned by the company)

Just hear me out:   Im sure people there was a ton of people who bought cars the last couple years because of the fed printing money, now that they the fed slowed the printers and inflation is high as giraffe nuts, could there be something going on in this atrocious car market?!  i still see a lot of places hiring.. so is nobody working, how can they afford their car payments?! I am seeing a lot more inventory of used cars from 2020-21 at my local carmax. Gas is about to go up could that be the catalyst for people to dump their cars? again idk what I am talking about but just noticing things around me.      How are used cars appreciating, they almost cost as much as a brand spanking new car!?    I know there is a "chip shortage" but i dont believe it. Make it make sense.   I feel like i am thinking about this too much lately. I can feel it in my balls.

760	1	2 Beaten-Down Biotech Stocks That Could Make You Filthy Rich These unloved biotechs have enormous upside potential.   George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Feb 7, 2022 at 10:45AM Author Bio  Key Points Biotech stocks have been some of the worst-performing equities over the past four months. Shares of Gritsone bio and Sorrento Therapeutics could sharply rebound later on this year. Motley Fool Issues Rare ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Buy Alert  Biotech stocks are going through a historic drawdown at the moment. Nearly 400 publicly traded biotech companies have lost 40% or more of their value in just the past six months. The market's irrational behavior toward all things biotech, however, isn't necessarily a bad thing for patient investors. Many of these beaten-down biotech stocks will ultimately rebound.  Which unloved biotech stocks are the most compelling buys amid this industrywide downturn? While there are scores of intriguing bargains in biotech right now, Gritstone bio (NASDAQ:GRTS) and Sorrento Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRNE) both have the potential to deliver life-changing gains for risk-tolerant investors. Here is a brief overview on the key value drivers associated with each stock.  Doctor fanning out money. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.  Gritstone bio: A hidden gem Gritstone's shares are down by almost 70%, relative to their 52-week high, at the time of this writing. This is one falling knife that investors might want to catch, however.  Despite the market's dour take on this clinical-stage immunotherapy company, Wall Street has remained steadfast in terms of its uber-positive outlook toward Gritstone. The average analyst price target on this stock, after all, implies a whopping 276% upside potential from current levels.   What's behind Wall Street's super bullish outlook? One big reason for this glowing optimism is Gritstone's next-generation messenger RNA (mRNA) tech. This tech, known as self-amplifying mRNA, has the potential to substantially boost the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines across a wide swath of indications. Gritstone hopes that its cutting-edge mRNA platform will ultimately lead to novel therapies for a variety of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and HIV, as well as a host of cancers.   What's the next big catalyst? While Gritstone's COVID vaccine work has garnered a fair amount of attention, the biotech's clinical program for microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer might be its crown jewel. Patients with this malignancy have few effective treatment options. Gritstone, as a result, could deliver a truly meaningful advancement in this space with its personalized RNA therapy known as Granite. The biotech is slated to update investors on its lead oncology program later this year; any positive developments on this front should be a healthy catalyst for Gritstone's shares.     Sorrento Therapeutics: A galaxy's worth of value drivers Shares of Sorrento Therapeutics are presently down by a jaw-dropping 80% from their 52-week high. Wall Street, though, thinks this beaten-down biotech stock could rise as much as 596% over the next 12 months.    What's behind Wall Street's bullish forecast? A few things. First up, Sorrento is on the cusp of building out a robust product franchise for COVID. Keeping with this theme, the biotech already has an Emergency Use Authorization for its Covistix test in Mexico. This high-value franchise ought to net multiple additional product approvals over the course of 2022.   Next up, Sorrento's pipeline now harbors a potential franchise-level drug with its recently acquired immunotherapy abivertinib. The highlight here is that the drug posted exceptionally strong efficacy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, an indication that could garner blockbuster-level sales within a few short years. What's more, Sorrento is gearing up for trials of abivertinib in a broad range of high-dollar indications such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, prostate cancer, and graft-versus-host disease. Abivertinib, in turn, might eventually morph into a mega-blockbuster drug (greater than $5 billion in annual sales).  All things considered, Sorrento's hefty downturn doesn't appear to be warranted. Bargain hunters, therefore, might want to capitalize on the stock's recent weakness.

How will Meta do without their lead strategist who is now linked to Trump.

644	1	AMC is in the business of showing movies. Obviously. Their goals are simple: once consumers come to the theaters, sell them on upcharges, and give them a pleasant enough experience to repeat the cycle.      The flaw: They rely on others to drive traffic into their doors and the only growth avenue they have is buying more theaters.      My suggestion: Audiobooks -&gt; Create Anime -&gt; Original Content to sell to the big producers after airing exclusive.      Content is king. I happen to be embedded in the audiobook market. Do some quick research and you will see audiobooks are gaining in market share and revenue. The data varies, but you can see the annual revenue difference between audiobooks and movies is not too different.      WSB: Okay Retard? Why are you talking about audiobooks?   Me: You can buy the rights to an audio book for a few thousand dollars. You can do this and own the rights for a lifetime. I know this because I do this. Deploy your capital, buy audiobooks, give them as a reward for visiting the theater. Rent out a full listen on an app, do whatever, but you suddenly own something with a longer shelf life than a Tom Cruise movie.     WSB: Great, that doesn't explain the anime nonsense. Feed me a banana to understand.   ME: Glad you asked. You now purchased 1000 audiobooks. Stick them on the AMC app. You create a crowdsourced voting and funding platform that overlays on the app for that audiobook. If the title gains enough traction, or enough pledged funds, you produce the content. Anime over live reel to save costs. You can even award .25 cents for every movie ticket to apply to sync users to your app.      WSB: Why would AMC want to produce content when others do it for them already?   Me: Growth, Growth, and Growth. AMC's business model lacks expansion. If an anime show is paid for and you control the rights, why wouldn't you. The main thing here, is any of the giants can do this. Netflix, Amzon alread has with Vox Machina, and it really is an opportunity if you have the exposer. AMC has the exposure, capital, and capability. They can hire animation studios, only develop winners into big screen, and advance AMC from the sticky floor theater chain to a next generation powerhouse who not only sells seats, but creates content.        I tried really hard to keep this simple for everyone. Is the concept perfect? No. I also tried to follow the rules with this post. I tagged it as a discussion to see what you guys think AMC should do. If I broke some rule let me know so I can ask my wife's boyfriend - Chad, really nice guy - to get the next one approved.      Cheers, Marcus Sloss.

102	1	Is the bull run back on? Or is this market makers playing games? You be the judge‚Ä¶   Statistically speaking if spy opens red there is roughly an greater than 80% chance that SPY will also close red that day. Today we see that statistics are not always correct and why we have to put our biases behind us and focus on what the intraday chart shows us.   https://preview.redd.it/t29y4wywd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fe03fe32bd95699cd83928143af59bb99b1163e  Looking at this intraday chart you can see that as soon as market opened the bulls came out swinging and they never really let off the throttle till market closes. Looking at the chart now you can clearly see that bulls broke out, rejected the important 437 resistance, regained steam and then blasted through resistance to new highs. I wasn‚Äôt trading most of the day but I like many got burnt thinking the morning rip was the fake out and that we would sell off the rest of the day. Statistically speaking more times than not we would have been correct. Also it really didn‚Äôt seem like it wanted to break through that oh so important 437 resistance.   Bulls managed to brake this all the way to 441.07 to close here out today for a modest 1.25% gain. However, after hours saw an immediate sell off and is currently sitting between -0.55 to -0.6% right now and using the 8 ema as resistance instead of support.   https://preview.redd.it/qmhvdfcyd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c11447d825a6cdb86d84ff82de06da5e359f2d  Looking at my daily chart I can clearly see it is time to make a new channel and see if we can predict where spy is going to go next! Overall the way yesterdays candle finished as a hanging man I am beyond impressed the bulls pushed it green today. Interestingly enough today is technically a hanging man candle also. However, when I look at January 28th, 31st, February 1st and 2nd we actually are seeing a very similar setup today to that. That was the last time there was more than 3 consecutive green candles in a row in over 3 months. Today marks only the second time since December 21st that SPY has managed to have three green days in a row.   It is also noted that SPY has NOT closed a candle ABOVE the daily 50 ema since February 9th and has only closed one above it (including today) 3 times in over two months.   This is also the first FULL candle closed ABOVE the daily 20 ema since February 9th and before that it was on January 4th.  Now let me show you a few things I am watching for and seeing on this daily chart as we actually have a few different setups forming.   https://preview.redd.it/r1nhvmvzd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57521c5ea38ad089f76e609166469e79a1b1aa8d  First up we have this green channel here which COULD be the start of the bull run‚Ä¶ This channel allows us to move as high as the daily 100 ema before we would see much resistance which is around 445 currently.   https://preview.redd.it/lixzmov0e1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac86c49e56b8d49e652298c545a7675507100d0  Next we have the red bear market channel. This channel would allow SPY to gap up as high as 445-446 (right around the daily 100 EMA also) before it would see any real resistance.   Now one other thing that I notice looking at todays chart and why its actually very peculiar to me that we hit 441 intraday and rejected so hard downward after hours is that the previous highest high before today was also right at 441. We are currently seeing a double double top at 441 that would if it holds send us crashing back down. Interestingly enough we also have a double bottom near 415. Which if this plays out correctly we could be seeing the following movements to confirm a massive inverse head and shoulder pattern‚Ä¶   410 ÔÉ† 441 ÔÉ† 415 ÔÉ† 441 ÔÉ† 410?  If we continue to sell off it would be very interesting if we were to retest 410 from this level if bulls fail to regain strength. This pattern actually played out the exact same back in January/ February. 420 ÔÉ† 458 ÔÉ† 444 ÔÉ† 458 ÔÉ† 410.   History is not predictive of the future. However, it would be quite amazing to see one month+ longer inverse head and shoulders pattern lead right into another. Overall If spy fails to break higher than 441 tomorrow or beginning of next week I would be watching for the retest of 410 before we go any higher. However, if we manage to get a candle closed at or above 445 I am going to be convinced the bull run is back on (for now).   I am also watching for the possibility of a future 441 double top too. Currently on that path spy is on if it were to dip into next week but effectively trade sideways (much like it did end of January for its double top) we could beginning of April see a triple top at 441 that would surely cause quite the downside. We definitely have some big levels to watch out for tomorrow and next week.   Tomorrow is the quad witching day which historically in a BULL market results in a usually pretty red day. However, in a bear market im not quite sure what to expect. Chart wise I would be pretty impressed with a 4th red day but the fact that Mondays low was 415.79 and we closed today at 441.07 means that SPY from Mondays low to todays high has gone up over 5.9%. That is an absolute massive gain for one week. Especially when you factor in that spy up until today had not closed back to back green candles in over a month. But for reference the last time SPY had 4 back to back days of green in a row end of January/ beginning of February spy managed to gain over 7.1% in 4 days.   The one thing we can guaranteed is that we do not know exactly what the market is going to do and we can only be along for the ride. Many of you probably are thinking its time to enter puts because surely its going to go back down. But the one thing we have to remember is that stocks historically go up not down. So in the end as much as this is clearly a bear market we are in‚Ä¶ in the end we are fighting the overall bigger bull trend.   I am staring at this chart looking for confirmation one way or the other and honestly I cant say I have any. If we break 445 I think that is a bigger signal we are back for the bull run but if we were to get back under 420 range I would think we see 400 before we see 460. In the end today was a massive break for the bulls BUT if you remember back to January. February when we had the massive ‚ÄúV‚Äù recovery from 420 the channel resistance we were in broke yet we continued lower. Again history doesn‚Äôt repeat itself but I am seeing quite a few bear case scenarios vs bull scenarios right now.   The best thing the bulls do have going for them though is that the VIX is still historically higher than usual sitting at 26. Most of the ‚Äúfear‚Äù around FOMC, rate hikes, war, inflation, etc. is truly (from the horses mouth JPOW himself) PRICED IN. So unless something wild and new happens we should see the VIX attempt to lower itself down into the teens again. The natural easing of fear and the VIX returning to its average below 20 should allow SPY to head back near 450-460s.   I do ponder if we see a return to a short lived bull run before the next CPI, FOMC and Rate hike.   This weeks FOMC minutes release on April 7th. And the next FOMC meeting is April 27th.   The next CPI is not until April 12th  With all that bulls do have some freedom for the next few weeks to unleash the beast again. Tomororw will be an interesting day with the quad witching though but Monday should start the ‚Äúnew trend.‚Äù   Remember- DM if you wanna keep getting these updates after April 2nd as they will no longer be posted to reddit.
657	0	You may know me from such dim-witted hits as "Peloton is going to tank on earnings, here's why" and "Facebook and PayPal have to bounce back up right?!"  I was using the few braincells I have left and came up with a novel idea: why do people even buy calls on earnings? IV crush just eats away at potential profits even if you happen to guess the direction correctly in this increasingly irrational market.   Why don't people just buy or short shares of a company if they think it will go down or up on earnings? I tried the options thing and even when I guessed correctly I either ended up losing money or made so little that it wasn't worth the initial risk.   I for one am going to start making smarter plays and rely less on chance and increase my odds of success!
569	0	Gonna use my own advices since taking other‚Äôs advice here is like Russian roulette except there‚Äôs 5 bullets instead of just 1. After lots of evaluation, here‚Äôs the [formula](https://www.readingrockets.org/images/articles/52243-a1.jpg) I came up with.   This month I‚Äôve been getting tossed around by calls and puts like a hooker on happy hour. I see some users talk about how Disney was going to fail somehow, but you never fuck with the mouse.   I‚Äôm trying to stretch my account value, not my asshole, therefore I should reverse psychology to outplay the market.   My theories? If you even read this far, listen to this.  Now, I would initially say puts on LCID, but what if we did calls? At my local mall they‚Äôve recently set up a Lucid store with an actual car within. Car looked inside it was it really nice. Bunch of people there too all looking around.   According to an [article by wccftech](https://wccftech.com/the-latest-snapshot-of-institutional-holdings-in-lucid-group-lcid-shares-and-what-to-expect-during-the-upcoming-q4-2022-earnings/amp/)   ‚ÄúAs an illustration, the company is expected to report $59.87 million in revenue for Q4 2021 and a non-GAAP EPS of -$0.30.‚Äù  Also  ‚ÄúLucid Group is also expected to provide critical financial guidance for the rest of 2022. As per the current consensus expectations of analysts, the company should report Q1 2022 revenue of around $212 million.‚Äù   The stock itself is low as hell, which means it‚Äôs only going to go tits up.   But before you say ‚Äúyou fucking retard, what you just said was that it‚Äôs going to up, so why are you doing a call?‚Äù Get off the toilet while browsing Reddit and I‚Äôll tell you why.  Companies that both reached earnings or missed expectations has had their stock price does the complete opposite for whatever reason. MTCH. FSLY. PTLR. This has made me believe that this stock has the possibility of being no different.  It‚Äôs literally 4D chess. No way this‚Äôll fail.
857	0	Example 1: Match.  We all saw the dd I wrote on match. Somehow the fat women and bots that want to steal your money managed to bench press this stock up to $120 today.   They had absolutely terrible earnings. Like, really really bad. But they mentioned meta verse dating and tinder coin (no I‚Äôm not kidding) so they rocketed.   The play was at the top of WSB and all over the stock forums. I guarantee you those market makers saw the post and decided to fuck retail over. Did anyone else notice the option chain got new strikes only on the downside end? Seemed odd.   Example 2: PayPal  Yesterday as I was doing my rounds on webull, Stocktwits, and yahoo forums like the degenerate I am and almost every comment was bullish on PayPal earnings before the market close . There were plenty of people saying 185! 195! Back to 200! Practically no bears were there. The stock was also increasing all day to make people think it would rocket ah. I inversed the general retail yesterday and got puts. They paid nicely.    Example 3: Meta  Meta is really the last stock anyone in retail would‚Äôve predicted a 20% drop on. Considering a lot of companies have been using metaverse as their get out of a drop free card (match), you‚Äôd expect this to absolutely rocket on earnings the second they mention metaverse. MM‚Äôs knew retail would think this, and did the opposite. Wish I realized this at 3pm today and bought puts, but even I thought this was gonna rocket.

I've lost all my life savings over the last two years, including my house total of about 300k  Also my health both physical and mental.  I've been trading daily for two years, it's literally consumed my life, all for the sake of financial freedom and independence, I've willingly gave up that which I already had.   And now I slave on projects for a wealthy family who's grandparents made their wealth in the nazi slave trade.  Just to pay rent and my trading induced debts.  But my point here is that I will never give up because if I don't have my freedom and funding to establish my own businesses well, then there is no point in staying alive. So, I am here among the cuck memes fighting for my life. I'm going to trade myself into my first 500k. And that's all I need to start my business.

296	1	Coca cola imports around 100 metric tonnes of coca leaf every year to Stepan company, where it gets extracted into an alkaloid slurry (a black tarry mix of cocaine alkyloids and others). That gets sent to Mallinckrodt where cocaine is extracted to a tune of 1% gross yield from leaf. that's of 500-1000 kilos of cocaine. Coca cola makes up most of the coca imports into USA, and its supply chain is grandfathered in as the only one able to process coca material.   This is really about drugs, but I'm going to start with Mallinckrodt which is the most shifty character in this supply chain.  The main medicine they produce with cocaine is acthar gel, which is worth $800,000/L for a gross profit of $350MM yearly. that's only accounting for at most 50 liters of gel form cocaine, or about 50 kg if it were made of pure cocaine (it's not but for this I'm assuming some loss).   but then it goes to the medical supply market in raw form. for the AMAZING fucking price of $25/oz (page 33 of "Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs") so it aint worth shit. The demand for medical cocaine HCL in the usa for 2018? 29 KG.   Surely they can't be backdooring cocaine out of a publicly listed company?

So why did the stock never delist? It looks like they held it together just enough to make it all the way out of bankruptcy. So now we have a medical giant with a market cap of $9.2MM emerging from bankruptcy. And they're propped up by black market sales of most of their most addictive drugs.   Which includes fentanyl- which is why I could never suggest to buy this horrendously undervalued company, but by financials and fundamentals the company is worth more than 9 million in assets right now- by about 51 million on acthar's patent alone. These guys are likely providing sketchy buyers drugs that are killing Americans.   so why did this easy target not get shorted into the dirt? unable to borrow and unable to pay its debt, no money to buy shares back. It should have gone down as unsuccessful, with patents sold at auction. Why did no other corp acquire it? There's no reason why they'll stay at 0.12 per share- this is a company that was well over 1.2 billion market cap before bankruptcy with shares around $50.  The answer I believe lies in 420-920 missing kilos of 99.9% pure cocaine HCL every year.

236	1	 Numerous politicians bought energy plays BEFORE their run ups, and general discussions on banning Russian oil. Many are on committees privy to private information, including Defense and Energy. Many had not purchased energy plays before.  Just Some Examples:  Marjorie Taylor Greene bought American oil stocks, $CVX, war stocks, $LMT, and renewable energy stocks, $NEE, ONE DAY before the invasion and also tweeting: "War and rumors of war is incredibly profitable and convenient."  Robert Wittman bought $XLE (energy ETF) on January 28, 2022.  Mark Green (who frequently invests in energy stocks) recently bought up to $1M in $ET (Feb 9, 2022) and over $1M in $ENLC (between Feb 9-18, 2022).

238	1	I've noticed a lot of of posts in the community about how the Russian invasion of Ukraine is going to turn into WW3, or how oil prices will skyrocket to the moon.   I just wanted to point out a couple of things as a counter to this line of thought.  1. Assuming Russia defeats Ukraine's forces, then they would have to station anywhere from 30-40% of their entire military in Ukraine just to avoid losing it. That's means they won't have the manpower to take much more than Moldova at that point which they likely intend to do. Last thing Putin needs is to involve NATO when he will have to work a miracle just to keep what he's taken.  2. Of course oil prices will go up, but this isn't going to cause a recession. If anything this is a major profit making opportunity for USA to sell to EU at marked up prices. Gas at the pump certainly won't double overnight because of this change.  To be fair the odds of a nuclear conflict is higher because fog of war, and potential for misperceived threats but frankly this is not news we've all adjusted to this since before most of us were born and markets aren't likely to price in the fear of that.
566	1	Rite Aid (RAD) has been getting the shit kicked out of it for months, meanwhile rival CVS has risen during this time. Have you been to a Rite Aid? In my area, they are virtually indistinguishable from Walgreens and CVS. The difference I‚Äôm focusing on is how undervalued RAD is compared to its key competitors. I may be a little biased since my local Rite Aid isn‚Äôt being robbed daily (like the viral midtown Manhattan one) and may be nicer than the national average, but my thinking is how does this stock trade at $24-27 a year ago and end up in the basement at $10 or so now? Yeah they have debt, but it‚Äôs profitable and I understand they‚Äôre going to close down some of the worst performing stores. If they run leaner and continue to innovate like some of their competitors have, how is this not a good play? We all get colds and seasonal allergies, or need a Gatorade to cure that Saturday hangover - are people seriously skipping rite aid as consumers? People may tighten the belt on luxury items or specialty food, but they still need the basics that rite aid provides.  Now some people way smarter than me are probably going to point out that RAD doesn‚Äôt have competent management and there are likely some technical things I‚Äôve glossed over, so what am I missing here?   It‚Äôs arguably undervalued based on a few key metrics, and its a household name for your meds, frozen pizza, and vitamins. So methinks this could be a decent play. Then again I‚Äôm a fuckin‚Äô idiot. Not the crayon eating kind, but the kind just smart enough to know I‚Äôm likely missing something obvious. Or maybe this idiot squirrel just found a nut.   Long story short, I think RAD is really neat.
991	1	[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/s37cyt/new_video/) a link to the post from two weeks ago.  The trade was a purchase of $QQQ puts with a strike price of $285 and an expiry of March 18th. The trade showed up as an outlier in the code I wrote because of just how far out of the money the contracts were.  When I posted about this trade, $QQQ was at around $378. Now it is at around $340, and the put contracts are up over 400%.   The same Senator also bought out-of-the-money $MSFT and $AAPL puts slightly prior, which are also doing very well, up around 100% and 60% respectively.

The warrants expire in early 2024 and if that happens I will lose 100% of my investment.   I wholeheartedly believe in the company long term, but I have doubts about whether or not the warrants will print in time.   Those of you that are smarter than me, are risk on assets fucked for 2 years? I know it is tough to say, but I (obviously) have never invested in a time when there was a hike scare. I really don‚Äôt wanna find myself behind a Wendy‚Äôs in March 2024. Thank you in advance.

But I believe it's a sleeping giant that will see a massive upside swing once market volatility subsides. It has a very relatively low p/e compared to most of the big companies (Microsoft, Google, etc.) It just beat on earnings and has for a while now. They don't just sell watches, they make the computers that keep planes in the air and get them to the airport. They make equipment for the military. They're a tech company, a value company, and a growth company wrapped into one and it's steady getting pummeled as with everything else in the market. Huge BTD opportunity IMO (not financial advice) I'm getting some leaps, DCA some shares, and diamond handing until I see over $300.

I am fairly new to options trading and was just messing around but now am incredibly curious as to what technical error this is. BTW this is a simulated ToS account. If anyone can answer this then please comment below. I searched up $VIX on google and all that came up was $VXX news, something about the ticker having a slip up with its asset management but I am not sure if this relates to what happened here. here is also some filler text because it keeps getting deleted aghhhh I hate that it is simulated or should I be lucky i don't know just please give me relief!   https://preview.redd.it/2xh0a0nn89p81.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31dc7919c96faa813a320fe79647def3e79c260

665	1	https://astroshit.com/  Astroshit is a decentralized, reward bearing cryptocurrency. Just like the legend foretold, those who hold this cryptocurrency will be rewarded in coins that have real-world value, these coins will be Solana &amp; BNB and other coins as voted by the community. Investors will be able to purchase Astroshit on decentralized exchanges such as Pancakeswap which has almost $4B of trading volume every week, and later some of the biggest centralized exchanges on the planet.  Once the coin has been purchased, those who hold the coin will receive rewards in the form of Solana &amp; BNB amongst other coins. The more Astroshit that is held, the more rewards that are distributed to that holder. As we will cover in the tokenomics section, rewards from holding Astroshit will be financed using a taxing mechanism on those who sell the coin. The tax will be used to purchase Solana &amp; BNB and other coins on the BSC network and send these coins to holders of Astroshit. This means Astroshit can not only rise in value as demand increases for the coin, but those who hold Astroshit will also increase their wealth by accumulating Solana &amp; BNB and other coins.  Astroshit is fun, interesting and has the virality factor to become one of the biggest cryptocurrency projects this decade. However, this should not distract from the fact that we are a team that have the passion, technical expertise and experience to create an entire ecosystem that will use Astroshit as its main currency.

234	1	While everyone's running around crying about Putin making your dinosaur juice real expensive, our boy Ryan Cohen has been building a 150m stake in $BBBY. Ya know, the place where you buy nice white towels then get shit stains on them and return them 9 months later to some poor highschooler who makes $11/hr. That place.  &amp;#x200B;  I strongly contend that $BBBY will continue to squeeze and will ignite the meme mania once again. The market is desperate for MOMO and runners. I think OIL has shown that well.   https://preview.redd.it/zvclrkztiam81.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0ad8038d91932b73d2f502208623a742c6b994b  $BBBY had an excellent day today. The entire float traded hands yesterday. The new VPOC is at $15.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/u3qiw6gdjam81.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15035d8b8a7a94061a07c106e2b7f73dc1d455c3  We have a fair amount of supply to digest on the way back up to $30. Namely the $25 range.   IV has spiked to the moon. It's not worth buying calls on $BBBY... HOWEVER...  &amp;#x200B;  $BB is trading at an abysmal $6!!!!  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/01zvgq0fjam81.png?width=1478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7e1163eeb48d961fd44efc53159c894eff0d66  Now we're all smooth brains here.

SI is only around 6%. Now she's a bit of a heftier float at 571m, more akin to $AMC than $GME. BUT.. Her IV is as low as your IQ.  &amp;#x200B;  We can pick up $9C weeklies on $BB right now for $.01. **That's right one abe lincoln and you've got yourself some FD's.**   &amp;#x200B;  HERE'S THE PLAY!  $BBBY is gonna keep squeezing. I think after the float switched hands yesterday we see continued buying pressure. I mean shit Ryan Cohen himself said that $BBBY has enough value in $BABY to spin that off right now and be worth the entire market cap of $BBBY.   &amp;#x200B;  You can read his whole letter here: [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)  &amp;#x200B;  OK--SO WE'VE GOT IV THAT'S SPIKED FOR $BBBY. Be a degen and buy some calls, sure.   &amp;#x200B;  HOWEVER, the real money to be made is in the meme stocks that haven't run, are the most beaten down, and have the lowest IV. (even a simple IV spike from a huge market sell off, like we're experiencing now, or a meme stock craze would turn $.01 into $.50, that's a 50 bagger ladies and retards).   **Poositions:**  **4,500 $BB 9C 3/11**  **250 $BBBY 22.5C 3/11**  **5,000 Shares of $BB**  **2,000 Shares of $BBBY**

712	1	I've been collecting and publishing data on stock trading by US politicians. Last week I shared a post showing some of the best recent trades by US politicians. To satisfy the WallStreetBets loss porn fetish, I also wanted to share a list of some of the worst-time recent moves.  Top 5 worst moves  1. **Purchase of up to $100K worth of short-dated tech calls in early January by Representative James Langevin.** Langevin bought an assortment of call options in tickers such as $BABA, $RIVN, $FB, and $SQ. Needless to say, these contracts have not exactly been printing money while tech has been getting slaughtered. You can see the full list of transactions [here](https://twitter.com/QuiverCongress/status/1491421702122663937), along with specifics on the expiries and strikes prices of the various call options. 2. **Purchase of up to $50K in $FB call options with a $340 strike on December 31st by Representative Deborah Ross.** While the Jan. 20, 2023 expiry date on these contracts gives Rep. Ross some time for $FB to recover from its historic collapse last week, it was still a spectacularly poorly timed move. 3. **Purchase of $RBLX stock on November 19th by Rep. James Banks.** Banks bought Roblox stock on the same day it hit its all-time high price of $141. In the less than three months since then, it has dropped over 50%. 4. **Sale of up to $65K Activision ($ATVI) by Rep. David McKinley, weeks prior to announcement of acquisition by Microsoft**. The stock would jump over 30% following the news. 5. **Sale of Cerner ($CERN) by Rep. Peter Welch, weeks prior to announcement of acquisition by Oracle.** Similar to the above, $CERN has risen over 20% since Welch's sale. It seems like some politicians would benefit from a ban on trading, in order to protect them from their own paper-hand behavior.
2	1	After the latest Q4 earning calls for Gamestock there was an open discussion that was held by the WSB mods. During the live discussion one of the self-proclaimed financial tards from the bear side "claimed" that he was short Game company and that he was going to short it more based on the earnings call. I remember how smirk and stern you were and today I'm wondering if you're still alive gay bear. Be a real man and post the margin call in true WSB fashion if you really did short Gamestop and didn't just claim to do it for hubris. And to all the doubters, let me leave you with this question:  How does 1 person buying 100K shares bring in 14 Million of volume when the average per day is around 2-3 million? This is totally a normal move for a stock not manipulated and without news right? We only found RC bought the shares after market close, so the excuse of the chairman buying 100K shares rallied all the ape retail to follow suit can't be used right?  Ask yourself this from an objective point of view and if you still believe or don't question your predisposition of the manipulation, you're too far gone and controlled by the narrative they are feeding you.  1. Gamestop did not squeeze SEC filing says so. 2. There are run-ups every 3 months in 2021, why did it happen? Also how does 1 man buying 100K worth of shares cause over 14million in volume and today 20 million in volume? When the normal daily shares were around 1-3 million? 3. NFT marketplace + Block chain gaming = $$$ 4. Team is stacked, Matt Furlong, Mike Recupero, Matt Francis, all from Amazon, why would they leave one of the most valued companies to come to a meme stock company? 5. No insider is selling and Ryan Cohen bought more!  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I LOVE THIS STOCK MY CHAIRMAN AND THIS COMPANY

622	1	I'm subscribed to this guy on youtube called Richard Fain. He's a very smart guy who's a multi-millionaire. When he was 30, he realized he was tired of being broke and living from paycheck to paycheck. He started educating himself on the stock market, real estate, and different ways to "multiply money" as he calls it. He told himself he'll work a full time corporate job for 20 years and retire at the age of 50 so he can live the life of his dreams.  Well, he did it. He retired at 50 as a rich man. He multiplied his money many times over by investing in stocks and real estate. I watch his youtube videos because he gives great investing advice and communicates the info in a simple easy to understand fashion.  Richard released a video today about how you should take your money out of savings and invest it. He suggests doing that because he predicts a prolonged period of high inflation for the years to come. He said the worst thing you can do during periods of high inflation is just keep your money in the bank an d allow it to lose purchasing power. He's right.  After watching his video, I spent a lot of time researching this issue and I'm convinced that hyperinflation is in the future. JPOW's strategy to hike rates by 0.25 percent or 0.5 percent a few times this year is a joke! The only thing that has a chance of stopping the coming stagflation is a Volcker style eighties rate hike to 15-20 percent. Since we know that neither the Federal Reserve nor the US Govt will approve such a large hike due to the almost guaranteed mega recession and high unemployment afterwards, well then, we can be sure of hyperinflation in the future.  What do you think? Is there any way we can escape a future of stagflation? Any super secret ninja move that JPOW can do to magically prevent this horrible hyperinflation filled future?    If I'm right, then buy as much dried food, canned food, rice, beans, and bottled water as you can because food will get a lot more expensive in the future. If you can afford to buy a house or condo or car, buy it because as expensive as they are now, they'll get much more expensive in the future. Inflation is a bitch!

The Fed is now going to have to resist interest rate increases and inflation risk will lead to investors seeking yield over security.  Expect rocket fuel demand and supply constraints to lead to crude increases and record oil company profits.  The need for cybersecurity will boost cloud providers profit and PLTR will get a boost from new contracts. FB use will skyrocket as a means for interwar communications and IG will see record usership. Expect NASDAQ to blow up (literally?) and the DOW to rocket to the moon.

214	1	The price of crude oil will continue dropping. Putin will eventually withdraw from Ukraine but not until after several thousand more innocent Ukrainians have died at the hands of Putin. Roughly 1,300 Ukrainian civilians have already been bombed or shot to death, meanwhile, most of the EU (particularly Germany) continues to buy Russian oil as they are so pathetically reliant on it. Absolutely unforgivable.    Say what you want about America, but we gave Putin a big ‚ÄúFUCK YOU!‚Äù yesterday by cutting off Russian oil entirely. Americans are gladly willing to pay more at the pump meanwhile Germany won‚Äôt even entertain the thought a several-month-long mini-recession as a result of eliminating Russian oil. Germany would rather watch thousands of Ukrainians die daily by getting shot and bombed to death. Fucking disgusting.    Germany is the main decision maker in the EU. All of EU will follow suit. Barrels of oil will continue dropping in cost and $DRIP calls will print because the German government are cowardly in every sense of the word, and once again they will be on the wrong side of history.     God bless the USA and god bless the UK for having some fucking balls and standing up to Russia and it‚Äôs piece of shit pseudo-oligarchy government. Buy $DRIP Calls, print money, and consider donating some to war-torn Ukraine after this conflict is over.

Lately I have been doing quite well and am wanting to invest in some inexpensive dividend paying stocks.  I like buying &lt;5 dollars a share stocks, and preferable the sub 1 dollar range.   Please leave some recommendations for companies to research into that have good dividend yields :)   And thank you, I hope this is okay for this sub.   :) also if anyone wants to explain buying higher cost dividend stocks benefits vs cheaper dividend stocks please do.
388	1	We can no longer rely on Russia for oil, or on Russia to not bomb the shit out of Ukraine. The Saudis are allied with Russia and China and refuse to listen to Biden about pumping more oil to lower our prices.  Guess what though? The US can actually be energy independent and we have a ton of oil and gas here in the states that the gays don't allow us to access because of "the environment" or beyond beef something.  Northern Oil &amp; Gas (NOG) has a break even price of $45/barrel and we're currently pushing $100/barrel. News outlets are predicting $125/barrel VERY SOON.  This is bad for you and me and will launch the US into a recession, but NOG will moon. They're going to shatter profits this year and it's the perfect opportunity to roll calls forward.  **NOG OR BE NOGGED**  **BALLS DEEP NOG CALLS 23c 4/14**
667	0	Listen retards, there hasn‚Äôt been an earnings report that NVDA didn‚Äôt anally rape. Shit just beats it by 10 percent every damn time. With the current sell off, it might be a good time to load some cheap calls on them. Plus the whole Ukraine and Russia thing is overblown and there ain‚Äôt no way in hell Putin is retarded enough to start a world war.   He prolly did this to raise oil and gas prices and that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs it retards, oh and I might be down 65 percent on my calls but fuck it I think it will rebound; it‚Äôs the strongest stock out there and has insane demand for its products. That‚Äôs it retards
483	1	Have you been hearing much about Covid ever since the whole Russia invasion news got spammed all over your feed? I sure haven‚Äôt. America has forgotten what Covid even is. Just a little over a month ago omricon was rampant and all over the streets. Now Covid is apparently gone because Russia is invading Ukraine.  So eventually, this Russia news cycle will die down and this will end. I can guarantee you not long after that, or even sooner we will see a new Covid variant emerge. It‚Äôll probably be sometime in March and it will be the worst Covid variant you have ever heard of. The media will be mass reporting Covid news again and stocks like MRNA BNTX PFE will moon again. Covid cases will rise.   Just saying, this is a high risk play because there‚Äôs no guarantee Covid will come back with a vengeance or that the Russia news will die down that quickly. Buy at your own risk. The Covid stocks are deep in the red from their 52 week highs so it is possible to see them run again. Calls are cheap af on the Covid stocks right now though.   If you believe in this, I‚Äôd wait until after 2/24 because mrna has its earnings that day. Last time the stock dropped 20% on earnings. Also IV will get crushed. Of course there‚Äôs a possibility it‚Äôll gap up, but even if it does I rather wait for the Iv crush to make a long position.
460	0	You know the Fed isn't gonna raise rates as expected. If this Russia thing is for real. The market priced in the hikes already. Soo the market is about to rally like Mar 2020 boys.   Now will it dip hard first (maybe)  Will it take a second for this to set in (probably)  Does inflation have an excuse that doesn't point blame on who started it? (Definitely)
779	0	I thought that the mods just got rid of the Daily thread a few months ago. Didn't ask why, didn't really care. Now, though, I see that it just isn't showing up in my feed! Strangely, I can't post there either.   Anyone else encounter this issue? I want to get back to shitposting.
507	0	So I'm in finance, just started my second week at a new large company. My manager's personality did a complete 180 since the interview. Since day one she's has it out for me. We'll review a LARGE file for the FIRST time with no background to it, she'll ask me 10 questions and I'll get 9 right. From there she'll literally say that I have 0% understanding of the concept.  After only 5 days she's basically tried to "trap" 3 times. By this I mean she'll go over a report that takes an hour to build ONCE. She encourages questions but if I actually ask one she'll simply say "did you really just ask that?"and never answer my question. Then she'll call her manager tell me to redo it in front of him, I'll complete like 85% of it on my first try with literally no assistance and then she goes on to make the argument to her manager that I'm simply not getting it.  Her expectation is the the moment I open any file for the first time I understand immediately how to run it and how everything conceptually works.  She's super rude and has threatened to escalate my "situation" to HR.  I just don't know where to go from here. My self-respect is worth more than this job but I feel bad because I rejected another offer (they already offered that job to someone else, I checked) for my current job. And so i feel like this job is wasting my time. I also do not just want to quit because it sets a bad precedent for me on how to handle a bad boss for future. My current boss is working hard to strip away my responsibilities and most likely get me fired/demoted.  How do you suggest I proceed?  A. Work hard to get her to like me. (I've been doing this, a lot but the situation is not improving)  B. Ask to move to another department. (not sure how this will play out, good chance I'll get fired sooner)  C. Talk to HR/her Supervisor. (Again I've been here for 6 days and she's been there for years so unless she has a problematic history, i don't see them taking my side)  D. Lawyer up. (not my first choice, but I'm honestly super pissed that I rejected another job only for them to pull this shit on me.  E. Other

64	0	I started investing a coupla three years ago and I will need to change the way that I do my taxes from now on.   I‚Äôve always just filed a simple return but now I need to look at protecting my assess for me and my kids and not paying more than my fair share  How do I go about finding a good ‚Äútax guy‚Äù? CPA? Tax attorney? What do I need?  Where do I look? What kind of questions do I ask them?  THANKS
782	0	Anyone here tried turbos, futures, mini-futures, options on futures, forex, Forex options, CFD and other derivatives?  If yes, how was it? Did you win? Were you emotions on the Roof? Any cool loss porn to show us?
821	1	That pop AH seemed a little odd to me. Considering inflation was 6.2% in October, 6.8% in November, and 7% in December, and Amazon only walked away with a 24% increase in revenue, this leaves me a little puzzled. Especially considering this all went down during the holiday season.  &amp;#x200B;  Let's take a look at Amazons 2021 Quarterly Revenue:  * **$108.5B**  \- Q1 21 * **$113B** \- Q2 21 * **$110.8B** \- Q3 21 * **$137B** \- Q4 21  Since I don't have a breakdown of monthly revenue, I want to take the $110B earned in Q3 and see what it equates to adjusted for inflation compared to Q4 dollars:   (October inflation was 6.2%)   * $110.8 \* 1.062 = $117.44  (November inflation was 6.8%)   * $117.44 \* 1.068 = 125.43  (December inflation was 7%)   * $125.43 \* 1.07 = $134.21  So by comparison, Amazon's Q4 earnings weren't much larger in terms of value than Q3, it's just a mirage of inflation. The inflation adjusted increase equates to a 2% increase in value. It's also important to note that the holiday shopping season is notoriously good for   retail as people spend money on shit they don't need. Even though it was believed that the majority of shoppers bought early (Q3) to beat the covid rush for the holidays, it seems that it is only partially true.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking forward to Q1 22 I don't believe it's possible that Amazon will outdo itself on earnings for three reasons.  1. Holidays are over, less impulsive spending 2. An increase in membership fee didn't fare well for Netflix 3. With inflation and stagnating wages, people have less disposable income.  No position on Amazon. I am all cash waiting to buy in on the big dipper.
867	0	So my wife got a new job and with that came a financial advisor knocking. Through our first few meetings, I‚Äôve been asking normal questions blah blah blah.  I wanted to get a feel for their thoughts on the current market because it was down roughly 12% at the time and I asked if she thought it would just be a correction or would it turn to a bear market? Her response was ‚Äúa correction is a 20% drop from the top, it‚Äôs a common misconception that it‚Äôs 10%‚Äù  I need to fire her, right?
582	0	I'll keep it short because this is wsb and sounding out words can get really tiring for people.  Putin worked for the KGB for 16 years. Later, he was director of the FSB (what the KGB was changed to).  If you think he's into some basic bitch thinking about his plans and tactics, you're a retard.   No, he's not faking a war with 130,000 because he has AAPL puts. No, he's not scared. Whatever is happening, he's already thought of and planned for it.   Shit, he was trying to get Trump to leave NATO five years ago. This Ukraine thing isn't something he came up with on the fly.   On Feb. 15th, there were a few DDOS attacks in the Ukraine. The ministry of defense was hacked. Mirohost - the company that hosts military websites was attacked.  Didn't do much damage - just shut down sites for a couple hours. No biggie.  So why do it?  Why do something that provokes people and shows you are attacking Ukraine while saying that you're pulling out troops?  Because hackers use DDOS attacks as a distraction [https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/ddos-as-a-distraction/](https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/ddos-as-a-distraction/)  Assuming you got some intel out of it, who wouldn't take a couple days to rejig their plan of attack?
137	0	Quick question, I‚Äôm very new to stocks and don‚Äôt know everything going on with the company but I would‚Äôve expected the Tesla stock to go up as the gas prices rose? (Higher gas price -&gt; more electric cars being sold). Why has it been dropping?
