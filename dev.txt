Actually, he announced he was working on a new album back on January 10th:  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.complex.com/music/lil-yachty-next-album-non-rap-alternative](https://www.complex.com/music/lil-yachty-next-album-non-rap-alternative)  &amp;#x200B;  And not a few days later does the market fucking tank. It seems that people are starting to use the Yachty Indicator to properly front run market corrections...
792	1	**Product Line**  Tesla have limited product line when it comes to EV’s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses.   **Margins**  Tesla’s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin – 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross – 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that’s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years.   **Valuation &amp; Market Share**   The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford’s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla’s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That’s changing now!!   Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that’s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV’s   ·**Moat**  Tesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV’s and automation. With time and effort that’s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV’s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation.   **Marketing**  Tesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!   **High Interest rate Environment**   We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter.   ·**Team**  Last but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer

611	1	Here's an alternative way to visualize your portfolio: [https://imgur.com/a/seocJxq](https://imgur.com/a/seocJxq)  On the x-axis is market cap, and on the y-axis is how many billionths of the entire company's market cap I hold. The bubbles are scaled by the nominal value of the holdings.   Calculating your billionths is simple to make in google sheets.      = shares * GOOGLEFINANCE(ticker, "price") / (GOOGLEFINANCE(ticker, "marketcap") / 1e9)  Eventually I'll measure in millionths.
46	1	Apart from GME, the US Mint is one of the best short opportunities available right now.   With the copper spot price near ATH and the recent squeeze in nickel prices, it now costs the US Mint  2.1 cents to mint a penny and 9.9 cents for a nickel. That's immediately a -52% and -49% loss, respectively which is worse than the YTD performance of ARKK.  The US Mint literally prints money and stills loses money.  I want to short these retards but I just need to find a way

I’m already banned from purchasing with Robinhood for 90 Days because my initial investment didn’t process with Robinhood - although I had enough in my account. Not sure what happened, but I would prefer to start investing before March 31, 2022. Thanks.
468	0	Some autists believe in going for the traditional bombs, drones, and missiles route with Lockheed, Boeing, and the other losers.  But with this being the "New Cold War" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/cold-war-ii-arrives-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine-sanctions-us-biden-europe-11645571764](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cold-war-ii-arrives-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine-sanctions-us-biden-europe-11645571764)   What would make this cold war so new, everyone has nukes, top-tier fighter jets, tanks, satellites, elite forces, but the one area that Russia is doing a fantastic job in that without a doubt America will invest in soon is cyber warfare.  I've played lots of Call Of Duty Ghosts *to know what I'm talking about*, you know to press the left D-pad and screech сука блять, this will drop an EMP on the enemy and their minimaps and red dot sights are gone. Russia is doing something similar to this by going into Windows CMD and DDOSing Ukrainian websites, and they have a track record of other malicious hacking.  Wouldn't America and other countries want to develop the same or better capabilities, like give contracts to certain companies like IBM, Intel (labs), Nvidia, Google, etc. to develop technologies like advancing their quantum computing research to break through encryption and other shit? Or on the private side companies like Cloudflare protect against foreign attacks.  I'm probably gonna just buy calls for IBM for the next year in hopes of something good \*or bad\*.

Anyways, I still haven't tried coffee, but thought I'd bring a cool opportunity to anyone who has tried flipping/gambling in the NFT space. I created the ultimate NFT project for degens who think they are lucky. Essentially, you buy a fortune cookie and get paid out big if you get a rare one. I thought this might be a fun way to try your luck in a way that isn't weekly options with the market going crazy right now.

In that kind of a scenario, I can see the US/West being unable to respond effectively militarily or with sanctions. In many ways, this would be the start of a new global hot/cold war.  The economic and political impacts would be cataclysmic.

273	0	This is a stupid rant. Monkey brained fired and I thought it would be great to share here. The fed should buy the dip just like before and make the market go up.  Leverage the power of the dollar to stabilize the market and then slowly trickle it back over time. The more the fed owns, the more of a dampening effect it would have on volatility in general. Just keep interest rates near zero and give our stimulus out permanently every month which gets adjusted for inflation. Whoever invests their checks every month the best will have the most. Inflation would be a thing.  If bills where paid by stimulus every month, convince me why that matters assuming you own stocks and don’t hold cash.
83	1	Well this is what I'm thinking, keep in mind. i'm in highschool and fairly new to trading so this might be really stupid, if so please tell me because I don't want to lose money.  Here's my thought:  Currently their are peace talks in Ukraine, these peace talks will either end two ways, Either:  A: Russia and Ukraine make peace, in which case the market rally's  or,  B: Ukraine and Russia become locked in the the same state they are now, thus, no change  If A happens the market will go up, If B happens I believe the market will also go up, as lots of the volatility of the market was generated from the confusion around Chinas response, and our supply lines. Now that these issues are resolved I believe over the next month the SMP has a really good chance of going up 5-10% offsetting the market correction that happened a month ago.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks for hearing me out, if this is dumb, tell me i wont be offended, I want to learn more.
579	0	First of all, I am writing this from a Facebook Customer (not user) point of view, also someone who was in the IT/TMT industry. I do not invest in the stock market, I don't play financial games, and I have no interest in making bets.   The reason I am writing this is that I want to give my two cents as someone who works in this field and might know a bit more insight detail about how shitty Facebook has become for advertisers, WHO CONTRIBUTE TO FACEBOOK'S REVENUE. I gave this advice to my buddies back in May and also October of 2021 and they've made some pretty good money when FB crashed (well, I am from NYC and a grad from a business school that's ten minutes away from Wall Street).  **I**.        iOS 14.5 Update Impact  1.        Before iOS 14.5 Update: The obvious reason that everyone knows, is Apple's iOS 14.5 update killed FB advertising ROI, right before the update my friends and I who are all working in the eCommerce field can easily make high ROI ads because the FB ads algorithm works wonders. we can easily attain a minimum of 300% ROI on our ad spend, and most of the time it averages 500% for low-medium priced products and 1000%+ for high ticket products. This is the norm for the eCommerce industry using Facebook ads combined with professional marketers and content creators. I was a solo player doing it all myself with no professional help and I was able to get 400% ROI as well.  2.        After Update: Now, since the update, our ads died, no matter what we tried we never got ROI over 500%, my average ROI on ad spend average is less than 200% since the update till today. Most of my friends working in the eCommerce industry quit Facebook ads because it is not profitable anymore, I am not talking about one or two, but hundreds or even thousands of eCommerce advertisers. They are not spending any more on FB ads and moved on to other platforms such as Google, Pinterest, and Tik Tok (I will get to this big part soon). At first, we thought it's gonna take some time for Facebook to catch up on the data lost and eventually get back on our feet, but it's been a year and we sincerely do not see the hope of getting back to what it used to be. Another indicator of this is that Facebook's revenue from mobile ads is much much greater than their non-mobile ads, part of this contributes to the much larger customer base, but another part of this is because mobile ads provide much more user data than non-mobile devices for FB to target better. I tried this personally because Facebook allows us to advertise and target based on devices, non-mobile device users deliver extremely shitty results.  3.        Effect Across All Categories: The shitty ads ROI not only reflected on the eCommerce field but also one of the major fields that bring billions to FB: Apps and Games. Apps and Games rely heavily on FB for acquiring new users, but since no data is available for FB to target better, it has become extremely expensive to acquire new users and force developers to shift their marketing budget to other platforms (Google/Youtube, Apple, Tik Tok). This is information is provided by my buddy who works at Hypergryph Network Technology Co. Ltd in China, the developer of popular online game Arknights. He was also a former analyzer at ByteDance.  4.        TLDR: FB ads are shit now, will not rebound. Advertisers are moving away from FB  **II**.        Failing Attempt On Ecommerce  1.        FB Knows Nothing About eCommerce: Everyone knows that eCommerce is big for the internet, but not FB. Seriously, for years FB only provides ads service to the eCommerce ecosystem and nothing else. It was super easy money for them because ads spend is the easiest profit to catch and everything else is hard, dirty work that requires a lot of resources, talent, and investment. Facebook only attempted to get into the eCommerce domain seriously right after the iOS update because that is the only way they can save user purchase data on their system. Facebook Shop and Instagram Shop were only available after the update and they did a half-ass job on it, the design, backend, bugs, cross-function coordination is just a nightmare. Shop users facing bugs every day and I was unable to create offers and product launches for months during the peak holiday season.  2.        FB Cross-function Coordination: This is a big issue here for FB. One of the reasons I warned my friends at Wall Street in October is because FB was rolling out a big promotion for all Shop users, FB was paying for all of the shipping costs and giving big discounts for the customers using FB Shop and Instagram Shop. They cover Shipping up to $20 and discount up to $100. For example, a customer can go on my Facebook Shop and purchase a product for $5, and he will pay $5 for the order. I can set the shipping fee to $20, FB will need to pay me $25 for this order and they only receive $5 from the customer. This is great for eCommerce owners because it will boost sales and acquire a large amount of Shop users for FB. The problem? We have no way to advertise this deal, FB Ads department is like completely in another dimension when this promotion was going on. When we run ads on Facebook, we can drive the traffic to anywhere such as our Business Page, website, or a single post, ads piece, but when they launch the Shop service, the option is not on the FB Ads, aka WE CAN NOT DRIVE TRAFFIC TO FB SHOP USING FB ADS DIRECTLY. This is a complete disaster because we have to drive the traffic first to our FB Page or our Website, and then direct the customers to the Shop page, if you work in the internet industry you know that every step will drive away more than 50% of the users because human is lazy as f\*\*k. What this means for Facebook, when the eCommerce department of FB is spending perhaps millions and millions of dollar subsidizing FB Shop owners, their Ads department are wasting millions and millions of dollar driving traffics elsewhere but not directly to FB Shop which will be much more effective.  3.        Supply Chain and Logistics: The only reason I brought this up is that FB was trying to get into the eCommerce domain. Unlike Amazon, which has supply chain management groups in China to source products and manufactures, warehouses to store inventory, provide fleets to deliver packages. FB has nothing, even Shopify is doing much better than FB, and Shopify is building their logistic warehouse and delivery service (Go Shopify!). You cannot be an eCommerce platform if you have none of these, the only thing FB provides is ads, their agency in China have no communication whatsoever in the supply chain field, they are only there to open new ads account and collect money, period.  4.        TLDR: Facebook Ecommerce is failing, it’s lacking users, shop owners, logistics, supply chain. The internal issue is also holding it back, FB is only good in Ads. A sign that FB is not good at diversifying its income.  **III**.        Tik Tok Challenge  1.        User Challenge: I think everyone knows about this so I am not going into much detail, basically Tik Tok users are growing extremely fast and eating up the market share of Facebook. Not only this, but the users are much younger and spend much more time browsing the videos, which means the future is in Tik Tok’s hands. There is a lot of hating going on on Tik Tok because you cannot change the fact that young users are addicted to it. Instagram comes up with Reel as a response but it is also a half-assed job. Just like they come up with Story in response to Snapchat, they are copycats that cannot challenge the original. According to Al Ries and Jack Trout’s Positioning theory for marketing, once a brand is positioned in the mind of a consumer, it is extremely hard to change. Tik Tok is the king of a short video app, period. If FB run Reels as an independent app instead of an add-on feature on Instagram, it would’ve been much better because a separate app/brand not associated with FB is easier to market than a subsidy.  2.        Ads Challenge: Needless to say, TT and FB are in the same business, they are big on the advertising business. The difference is their algorithm and method, FB rely heavily on user data since day 1 of their inception. They kept it this way and thought that this will not change, but uh oh, Apple just said FU and shoved a middle finger right at Zuck’s face. Google is about to do the same soon. TT, on the other hand, also exploits user data heavily but they have come up with new ways to partner with advertisers. Not only do they provide a platform for advertisers to run ads automatically, but they also have partnerships on running organic traffic challenges across their platform for more viral effects. In other words, Facebook lets the advertisers do all the work, rely solely on their algorithm, but TT gives the option of doing work together, this is a big incentive for big advertisers because it will gain an advantage over small advertisers. You can see a lot of video challenges going on TT and a lot of them are events organized by TT to promote for big customers. TT as a new player in town was actually behind FB because TT lacks the data of the worldwide user that FB has been collecting and using for years, but now the loss of these data would put them in the same position.  p.s Google is in the Ads business, too, but their service is inelastic as FB services are more elastic. Also, FB collects data from users, but users provide Google with data voluntarily.  3.        eCommerce Challenge: this is a very important advantage of TT, as you may know, TT has a Chinese counterpart: Douyin in China, they have been exploring e-commerce for years and was wildly successful. Tik Tok Shop is bringing billions of GMV for ByteDance and eating up the market share of top players such as Alibaba and [JD.com](https://JD.com). TT as the global version of Douyin can try and duplicate the success of eCommerce on a global scale. With already established supply chain, vendors, and manufacturer relationship, it’s easy for them to convince these Chinese Sellers to go global (mind you that global eCommerce is a big industry in China, and the majority of sellers on Amazon are also based in China). Their biggest challenge is logistics. In my honest opinion and reliable sources, TT is doing much much better than FB, they may not have as much user data as FB, but I believe they have more consumer buyer data than FB and they can improve their eCommerce algorithm with these.   p.s. my former eCommerce partner sells phone cases on Douyin (China) using their Shop and Ads system, their annual revenue is about $30 to $40 million with a 30% net profit margin for years 2019-2021  4.        Other Fields: this is purely my opinion, I used to work in the TMT industry in Beijing with friends and clients from companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and ByteDance, basically all the big tech companies. ByteDance has a very strong crisis awareness and it is always looking into diversifying its portfolio, they have tried medical, education, gaming, media, entertainment, eCommerce, and enterprise service. Not only do they enter these domains, but also leverage their strength of user traffic to succeed in these fields. In contrast, Facebook purchased Instagram and Whatsapp and contains itself in the social network and advertising domain. Their biggest step out was the purchase of Oculus VR and Meta concept. VR and Meta are nowhere to be profitable soon because of hardware limitations for our era, period (prediction from former executives of Qualcomm, also clients from Huawei, no one in the hardware industry believes in the VR concept, HTC believed in it and look where they are now).  5.        TLDR: Tik Tok is eating up FB’s market slowly, they are also doing a better job on other domains such as eCommerce than FB did. FB’s only income is advertising and their services are not inelastic like Google.  &amp;#x200B;  It is late here in NYC and I am tired, this is everything I have in mind regarding Facebook. Like I said in the beginning, I am an outsider in the world of Wall Street, I just hope this information I provided can be some help for everyone here. Of course, don’t just take my words for it because these are purely my personal experience and observation around the industry that I am in. I am happy to answer any questions you may have for me, not just for FB. I also welcome anyone who has a different opinion and is willing to explain it.

584	0	(https://imgur.com/a/t5fvdAY)  Seriously guys, don't risk more than 1-2% of your portfolio when leverage trading. I learned this the tough way. Literally lost about $43k in a single trade when doing a 100x. It sucks because I could've gotten out of it with substantial profit, but got greedy and things went real south. Losing that much triggered my emotions so it became a series of ups and downs; went as far as trading up to 50% of my portfolio in a single 100x leverage trade until I had to stop myself. Ended up losing about 65% of my portfolio in the end which nearly broke me but I'm starting to feel more content about it now. Especially knowing how dumb I was and don't deserve to have all that money anyways. It's crazy thinking I was doing doordash 5 months ago, started Nfts and made over $200k in 1 month, only to lose most of it in 3 days. Big yikes.

We keep kicking this can down the road and we will need to pay up soon. The Feds and policymakers are in bed with big money. We the people need to understand that we are getting robbed in broad daylight. I made decent gains last year in the market, but understand that my standard of living is degrading daily due to inflation. We should be aggressively tackling this problem and not babying the freaking market. It's either you take the hit now or keep kicking that can down the road and take a wallop later. China is taking the lumps now. They are watching out for their real economy instead of babying equities. They understand it's better for their future. We in the US need to tell our leaders to wake the hell up.   Is this an inmate problem with maturing capitalism? What exactly are the Feds doing that is helping the general public?Even with the revised CPI formula, inflation numbers are through the roof. The Feds inflated and pumped so much liquidity into the market that it didn't keep us afloat, it ballooned us to epic proportions. All of you crying about the dip in January, we are basically are at Oct 2021 levels! While the economy was shutdown/stagnant and household debt increased dramatically last year, our market reached all time highs. We need to deflate this bubble, getting inflation under control and take our lumps now!

Biggest US banks and ranking agencies are involved.  The scheme was as follows: private company like rosneft (oil) would issue a bond with high ratings and sell it to irs fund. The % are higher than you see in normal western economy. Through bribery us banks and agencies will get their share. Now all those loans can't be paid due to sanctions. Maybe you heard tens of billions of dollars were stolen by russian mafia from covid relief funds? Well, here we have a system working for ten+ years. No one thought that top private companies will be under US sanctions and now they are.  Corporate greed has no boundaries on Wall Street

416	1	GFAI  just started getting noticed up 45%+ on the day. The stock is going up because the current market cap is only like 14M when the company is expecting over 30m in net revenues for the year 2021 and GFAI also locked in an extra 10M in a  private placement last week so thats even additional value. The market cap is like 14m or something and  the company actually has really good robotics compared to the competition. its a pretty good company actually, I'm surprised I found this one before big investment banks, the stock doesn't even have analyst coverage yet.  SINC is another interesting one. They are closing on an acquisition this quarter bringing in 7-12m in the company plus they recently  company retired 48  million shares earlier this year which brings down outstanding shares to 25m and the market cap to 17M at 0.68 cents a share. The company is  still undiscovered and has over 100 commercial customers. Also the public float is only like 520,000 shares so it can spike pretty hard when they announce the acquisition news.  SBEV  is another big one, The company is looking at some serious revenue growth, Walmart  distribution, Ralph’s/Kroger $KR distribution, TapouT popular in  UFC, celebrity/athlete partnerships, they company owns multiple lines of beverage brands, alcohol and non-alcohol. The CEO of SBEV is former VP of Redbull so he's well connected in the beverage industry.   OWUV is starting to heat up too . The  company is all over the place but in the hottest sectors. They are even  buying land in the Metaverse such as decentraland and sandbox,  celebrity/athlete partnerships, tubeless tires &amp;  more. It’s another solid company doing interesting things so keep it on  watch, but it ran up before so its a bit older but the other 3  are more fresh

But just look at the crash video. It's the same as the other 737 MAX crashes, unintended nose dives the pilot can't pull out of due to a malfunctioning of the MCAS system.   The Flight24 data makes it look very unlikely that the pilot was suicidal.   The 737-800 has an incredible safety record. The 737 MAX has a problem with nosediving and killing everyone on board. Now ask yourself, what do you think is really MORE LIKELY in this situation?

593	1	Strategists at RBC Capital Markets pointed out on Tuesday that international oil prices are expected to reach $115 a barrel this summer, but it is not the situation in Russia and Ukraine that plays a major role, but fundamental factors.  With the recovery of global demand from the epidemic, leading to tight supply, Brent crude oil prices rose by 50% in 2021, and US crude oil prices soared by about 60%. Since 2022, international oil prices have continued to sing all the way, pointing to the $100 mark.  Michael tran, managing director of RBC global energy strategy, pointed out that the rise in oil prices has not been due to geopolitical tensions in Europe, but because the "supply side shock absorber" is much weaker than before.  Tran predicts that major crude oil benchmarks such as West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Brent crude oil are expected to reach $115 a barrel this summer. He pointed out that compared with the progress of the situation between Russia and Ukraine, fundamental factors are more relevant to its prediction, and geopolitical tensions are only worth $7 to $10 a barrel in the current oil price.  On Wednesday, there was little change in international oil prices. Oil prices fell more than 3 per cent on Tuesday, falling from a seven-year high after Russia said some troops were returning to their bases after military exercises near Ukraine, a move that seemed to ease tensions between Moscow and the West.  Main factors play a fundamental role  Tran said that with the opening of Western economies after two years of epidemic restriction policies, the demand for crude oil has increased and the global inventory has decreased. OPEC + has almost no spare capacity to meet the growing demand, which is the main reason why the oil price may soon reach its target price of $115 a barrel.  "We believe that oil prices will rise sharply this quarter." He said.  Tran pointed out that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the stock of existing crude oil has been very low and is being depleted in a "terrible way".  Weekly U.S. oil inventory data show that oil inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, have fallen for five consecutive weeks to their lowest level in three years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its February oil market report that oil inventories in OECD member countries were at their lowest level in seven years.  Tran said that another factor in the rise in oil prices is that swing oil producing countries in OPEC + countries that can relatively quickly adapt to oversupply or strong demand are depleting idle capacity after increasing production from a lower level.  S &amp; P global Platts reported last week that OPEC and its allies fell behind the collective production quota of 700000 barrels in January.  Tran pointed out that the rising demand and the inability of manufacturers to meet the market mean that "you have effectively reduced the risk of shock absorbers on the supply side of the market."  Referring to the prospect of more oil returning to the market if Iran and world powers reach a new nuclear agreement, tran said that the timing of returning to the market is very important.  "I think if an agreement is really reached, the additional crude oil supply will make the market situation much better later this year than a year ago." He said.

348	1	There are five factors that the Russia-Ukraine conflict brings into force: Direct trade, Commodity Prices, Inflation, Supply Chains, and general uncertainty. Let’s dive into how each factor would influence the economy.  **Direct trade:** US imports very little from Russia directly. It was estimated to be only $35 Billion in 2019 compared to $615 Billion with China during the same period. This was intentionally done so as to minimize the reliance of our economy on the Russian economy after the Cold War. All the new sanctions imposed on Russia would relatively have very little impact on the U.S Economy.  **Commodity Prices:** This is one of the biggest concerns as Russia is meeting 10% of the global demand for oil. Even though the U.S imports comparatively little Russian oil, since the market is a global one, price increases elsewhere can directly affect our fuel prices. The European market is heavily dependent on Russian gas as you can see below. The cost per barrel of Oil surpassed $100 for the first time since 2014 last week!  https://preview.redd.it/ni0dh1p0wwk81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d0d143c503124b26fe8a56e55f30943613029ec  **Inflation &amp; Interest Rates:** The increasing commodity prices can push the already high inflation over the edge. [Analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/business/economy/russia-ukraine-global-us-economy.html) indicates that if the oil prices increase to $120 per barrel, the CPI could rise as much as 9% in the next couple of months. The ‘transitory’ nature of inflation that the Fed is hoping for might become permanent for the foreseeable future. This would also affect the Fed’s plan to increase the rates in March as usually rate increases are done in a strong market. Hiking the rates in a turbulent market as we are seeing now might push the indices further down.  **Supply Chain disruption:** High fuel costs and a disruption in sea and air trade routes can lead to [supply chain disruptions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2022/02/24/the-russia-ukraine-war-could-have-dire-impacts-on-global-supply-chains/?sh=5e99d8b24919). While the raw materials for which the US is reliant on Russia and Ukraine are minuscule, Ukraine is a massive exporter of wheat and Russia controls metal markets like Nickel and Copper. It is unclear whether [semiconductor supplies](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ukraine-war-flashes-neon-warning-lights-chips-2022-02-24/) will be affected, but if they are, that could trigger chip shortages and lead to a trickle-down effect on dependent industries.  **Uncertainty:** The most important factor that is affecting the market is uncertainty. Markets hate uncertainty and try to price in for the worst-case scenario. This is perfectly captured in the below chart with the market bottoming out during the start of the invasion and then bouncing back up once the war has started. Even though it does not cover all the conflicts, we can see that in most cases, **the anticipation of war causes more drops than the actual war itself**. The 2.2% bounceback that we saw on Friday further validates this theory.  https://preview.redd.it/vqk680t7wwk81.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baba7e1be52f7a160f8b9b433e5460ca8e86f0f0  On the whole, it seems like the overall market will recover from the dip, but the prospects for oil, wheat, metals, and businesses that rely on semiconductors are uncertain.  #### How have Geopolitical events affected the stock market?  This brilliant research conducted by [LPL Research](https://lplresearch.com/2020/01/08/how-stocks-do-during-geopolitical-events/) shows how the markets have behaved during the previous crisis. The S&amp;P 500 fell 5% on average during the last 20 major geopolitical events. But on average, the markets recovered within 50 days and if you remove the two outliers (Pearl Harbor Attack and Iraq’s invasion), the markets recovered in just 25 days. So there is a high chance that the current drop in the market would just be a brief dip.  https://preview.redd.it/y7b6ilc9wwk81.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=558894841f2b6d13e6e8c6163bb6647c4044310c  Both existing research and our analysis show that the market tends to price in the worst-case scenario just before the war starts. Once it starts, the markets tend to bounce back within a few weeks, and then it’s predominantly driven by macroeconomic conditions more than the war.

778	1	So was trump in on it or did he get played. Were the Dems in on it or did they get played. All thru the election and before, all this drama surrounding Ukraine.  The Russian propaganda machine has won and America doesn't give a shit about Ukraine. Its like that one friend thats so annoying you wish they would leave. Russia has every reason to make their move now. -the US doesn't want a war -Biden looks weak and provides the opportunity  -they want to show being part of NATO doesn't mean shit - strengthen their weapons exports when their new equipment wins over US equipment  -get rid of the fees Ukraine receives from the pipeline  The reports I am reading says 70% of Russia military will be on the border in two weeks. I'm not sure he is going to wait that long..  Trump gave Putin a underhand toss and all he has to do is hit the ball.  I'm going to cover all my positions with puts.
740	1	People are asking why wsb was so bearish and pton and why they were wrong, so, allow me to explain -- you people down voted my magnificent due diligence instead of upvoting it as I deserved.   Despite your lack of appreciation for my wisdom, here I am once again. I have dumbed it down somewhat and I will incorporate some folksy metaphors in an attempt to get my point across -- please enjoy.  Chapter 1, Two Kinds of Bears.  Two kinds of bears will hunt a stock in the wild. The first is the bear of overvaluation, the second is the bear of obscelescence. You may think of these two bears as the "anti-value" and the "anti-momentum" bears respectively. Just as value and momentum are the two market factors responsible for the bulk of stock price appreciation, so it is true that perceptions of weakness in either of these factors are the "bears" that prey on stocks and make them go down.   When both bears target a single stock simultaneously, they will mercilessly pummel the shit out of it. A recent example is FB(a stock I like, by the way) -- with the market beginning to perceive that FB is neither on the cutting edge nor particularly cheap, (depending on how you value the losses from reality labs), FB stock was mauled and assaulted by the two bears and thus fell drastically.   One bear is potentially survivable -- two bears at the same time is invariably gruesome.   PTON, like Facebook, is not seen as a particularly innovative company nor a particularly cheap one. PTON has been under assault for some time by both bears. Consequently the stock fell nearly 90% from its highs.  Yet, in this particular case, both bears have left not to return. The anti-value bear is repelled by the enormous layoffs and new CEO, a former CFO that make the meal unattractive to him.   The anti-momentum bear appears strong, yet mostly appears strong from temporary trends that favor him -- the fading of the coronavirus had given this bear courage, but it is a one time favor and sure to slip away.   PTONs return to growth is essentially a 100% certain outcome -- the question is around timeframe. I believe that within 12 months, the narrative of a recovery in the business will be widely accepted, and the stock will trade significantly higher -- $70 perhaps. And the market will adore the new CEO, this reinforcing the upward action mightily. In '23 it may set new all time highs. This is like the chipotle comeback, but bigger, faster, stronger. Frankly, 4 billion dollars in revenue can justify a 40 billion dollar valuation. A truth that is unpleasant for most of you to hear -- yet a truth all the same.   I like category leaders with inelasticity of price, network effects, and subscription revenue whose stability is backed by an expensive &amp; heavy piece of equipment -- call me crazy. 🤘🤘
809	0	First off, if you didn't buy the dip on January 24th at noon (which was bottom) than you're fucking retarded.   Secondly, who cares if the fed is raising interest rates in march (or beyond) money is still cheap AF to borrow (0%) compared to historical norms (5.47%) and will continue to be so unless the want to tank the entire world economy. It's absolute nonsense that you wouldn't invest your cash into stock market. Where else are you gonna put it? Real estate? Good luck to you cashing out quickly if there is a crash/rug pull. That's the great thing about stocks. It's a liquid asset as opposed to a hard asset that takes time to sell.  Don't be afraid retards, as daddy buffet says; buy the dip!

274	0	No way I can be the only feeling this way. I have about $13.5k in silver and gold and about 75% of my stock portfolio is weighted towards mining and energy stocks, and agricultural ETFs. I made a call towards the end of last year that inflation was going to kick the economy’s ass. And the war has added fuel to the flame.  Each morning I’m wake up and feel like I’m getting paid to watch a house burn down and do nothing about it.   Does anyone else feel the same moral dilemma? I know I’m winning and people that aren’t even taking positions  in the market are eating sh*t.   If you have a similar portfolio to mine, how do you cope? Looking for guidance, thanks.
959	0	Here is my play for tomorrow you retards may think its financial advice but it is not so dont nobody try this at home. Goldman Sachs has been telling its investors to buy gold since the last 4 days, they have zero confidence in the market and have lost all confidence in shitcoins. Since i refuse to invest in that shit I figured the best way to take advantage of the coming collapse is a sweet YOLO right at the top of the market which I believe is now. SPY gained almost 2.5% friday and the only way I see it goin is down so I'm byuing 2nd  feb SPY 420 puts (lol 420) and selling as soon as it's up 400%. This seems like a solid play and I'm investing everything I've managed to save over the last year. Lemme know if you apes think its a good idea.  This is not financial advise
898	1	I'm not fucking around.  Keep this stock in your mind.  TL;DR - $SAVA is an extremely unqiue play to be on the look out for as a bet.  $SAVA  Company: Cassava science  Long story short, this stock sky rocketed from $6.00 to like $140.00, and down to $40 and back up to $140.00 (range $40 back to $140), like 3 to 4 times in the last 12 months.  SAVA has engineered a break through medication for Alzheimers disease. (oral simufilam 100 mg)  Their drug enhances cognitive ability and reduces the progression of the onset of Alzheimer's.  11.3% of the worlds population develops Alzheimers dementia. That's a fucking huge number.  Shorts have been at this stock since day one. One "citizen" started a citizens petition for the FDA to halt SAVA under the basis of falsifying its data.  This person's lawyer was then quoted confirming that this individual held a short position in the stock a few days later ...  [https://ca.style.yahoo.com/science-journal-finds-no-evidence-143000104.html](https://ca.style.yahoo.com/science-journal-finds-no-evidence-143000104.html)  There is a citizens petition that was submitted to the FDA to seek it's approval to speed up the process of its safety and efficacy trials with the end goal of being fully FDA approved and brought to the market.  The CP or citizens petition for this request has 180 days for the FDA to finalize its review and provide their response.  This date is 2/22/2022.  Shorts have been at this fucking thing with MSM's like no tomorrow. They want it to fail, but the thing of it is, is that this is an actual real world prospect that could revultionize the current state of treatment for Alzheimers dementia and actually be the real deal.  Don't forget this is not just for the patients themselves, those with family who have members of their family spend a shit load of money either in the costs and expenses of long-term care facilities or actually being their care givers.  So far, their has been no feedback from the FDA. Phase 3 trials are still on-going with a dedicated website: [www.Rethink-ALZ.com](https://www.Rethink-ALZ.com) online to view the information by the company.  Things are looking very positive and there has been a lot of institutional buying.  Securities threshold list:  Well with the WSB mods getting all bitchy and shit with the removal of posting videos and pictures, here's the imgur: [https://imgur.com/a/ty5Sdn9](https://imgur.com/a/ty5Sdn9)  There's an immense support for this stock. It held the big dip we had like a breeze.  If this CP turns out to be anything positive which it's looking very likely to be, this is going to fucking ejaculate green crayons like JPOWW did money post 2022.  The shorts have been in this thing a very long time. This is not a short squeeze post or whatever, it's simply just a fact.  I see posts sometimes about this stock and some commenters always join in and say a "I'm bearish on this stock, the data is fake, the CEO this and that, etc" ... but the real truth is, is that there is a huge amount of highly acclaimed professionals within the science and medical community who are praising this drug and are looking more bullish then ever on it.  No serious side effects to date has been reported from this drug to my knowledge and it is currently beating the current medications on the market being used which are not effective against the diseases and this drug is still in its trial phases \[Third\] (close to FDA approval).  If the FDA have found anything conspicuous or of question throughout this time that has elapsed the clinical phase trials would have been halted/stopped. This has never happened.  "What is Cassava Sciences' current short interest? Short interest is the volume of Cassava Sciences shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. As of January 15th, investors have sold 12,990,000 shares of SAVA short. **34.82%** of Cassava Sciences' shares are currently sold short."

Positions:  $SAVA - 28 shares @ $45.00, will be looking at calls throughout this process  $GME   $XIU   Before the big dip that had passed (and may still occur again😂), these were my only holdings in my account and I didn't sell shit obviously.  Apart from the ETF and GME, to me $SAVA is a bet I'm really looking at getting a nice position in, figured I'd share my thoughts.

I remember this being talked about possibly happening before fighting even broke out.  Hopefully this is priced into the markets.  I do however need a new video card and I suspect this is going to drive up the prices on them despite them already being ridiculously high.....
136	1	## An ETN with no underlying asset To those not familiar, VXX is meant to track the VIX or Volatility Index. This is done by buying futures contracts of CBOE VIX. Normally, when a trader buys VXX, a new share is created and the issuer, Barclays, will buy a futures contract of VIX and a corresponding hedge. However, Barclays announced yesterday that they will no longer issue shares. So what does that mean? VXX now tracks nothing, so everyone that bought and sold VXX as a hedge or as a swing trade on volatility is trading nothing. Literally nothing.  ## Pure Supply And Demand Since VXX is no longer moored to VIX, which is market-wide indicator, it can now move freely. You can see this in the charts as VXX is up 10% while VIX is only up 3%. Theoretically, VXX could climb parabolically. A similar example would be TVIX which went 90% over NAV in February, 2012. Of course, in March 2012, it crashed when Credit Suisse restarted issuing. This led to many lawsuits as the timing was suspicious.  ## Infinite Money Glitch i.e. Gamma Squeeze It seems once again that Wall Street has come up with some exotic product that is not well understood and sells it for fees, but when times comes for them to pay up, they just turn off the product. They turn off the buy button, they stop issuing shares. Well, here's the thing. When ETNs no longer issue shares, it's no longer shortable. Just like TVIX this thing could blow the fuck up and TVIX didn't even offer options. Options expiry is this Friday and if you look at the options chain, there's a clear runway for VXX to hit at least $70 if not much much higher.

First of all, see in the chart below, it is approaching a resistance which has stood since the start of the year. Though the stock has not quite broke through the resistance yet, I do believe that it has the strength to do so based on the current set up and most recent ER. FDX is currently on a short term uptrend on high volume from a pretty good earnings. FDX missed on EPS by a little over a percent but crushed on revenue earning nearly 200 million more than what was expected by analysts. The overall sentiment for the ER can be summed up by how quickly the stock recovered after initially dumping on ER. Additionally, on the 4 hr chart, the MACD is still pointing towards further appreciation and the RSI has not yet reached the overbought portion of its range.  [4hr chart for FDX](https://preview.redd.it/208vvden2vo81.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d35507e580b482b258bf994a1529531f7c3d0ea)  Looking at the chart on a much smaller timeframe (30min), FDX is actually forming a wedge. On this timeframe, MACD also is pointing towards price appreciation and RSI is not yet overbought. the pattern resembles an inverse head an shoulders which is bullish and could breakout in the next couple days.   &amp;#x200B;  [30min chart for FDX](https://preview.redd.it/iop3ao6n4vo81.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46910e9b3899f663870f9f9566eaf8a8be32cce0)  Once again, this is just my opinion on the stock and how I think itll move in the next couple days, there are many other ways to interpret the chart.  Thanks and good luck to all this trading week.  Positions: 5/20 225c

Total combined income = $235,000  2) Start **OF couples account**. Can probably 1.5x income. You don't even have to do anything, just let the boyfriend record the content himself, all you gotta do it upload it on OF and niche subreddits.  3) Pay a bunch of **homeless people** to camp out at a neighborhood that you want to buy in. Wait a few weeks, then send direct mail to those houses that you are an out-of-state buyer and will buy with zero inspections and no realtor. As long as the price is right.  4) buy a cheap lot of land that is not zoned for residential. **Bribe the city building inspector** with money/sex to let you put a shed on the lot and live in it.  &amp;#x200B;  Any other ideas?
240	1	I understand that the Russian currency fell by 50% recently, but still that means that p/b =1 and p/e =4  A far cry from the 10 pe and 2 pb russia usually hovers around  I would say even when the currency falls by more because assets have a more consistent price they will hover around that value  The only question is, is there a easier way to make money I'm the next semester  I'd say the awnser is no...  Russia is in the middle of a war it arguably cannot sustain, full of sanctions their banks having their assets withheld  As long as the war ends in the next semester this is a easy 100% profit, just by using a regular buy and hold strategy for a couple months with a very low risk on a regular russia index (as worse case scenario pb is 0.5...)

This has been used as a card as far back as the Cuban Missile Crisis.

783	1	In the U.S. 900k people have died from COVID. In 2021 an estimated 52% of Americans had life insurance with the average payout being $168k.  52% of 900k at $168k works out to $78.6B in death benefits.  There's been 76.4M COVID cases in the U.S. with a 2.1% hospitalization rate. With an estimated 91.4% of Americans having health insurance all or part of 2020, that works out to approximately 14.6M hospitalization claims.  If the average claim is $30k, that works out to $438B in hospital claims, or $516.6B in claims in the U.S. for deaths and hospital stays.  This all seems to have been priced in during Q1 2020, but insurance companies appear to still be producing earnings as usual, and the market rebounded above pre-covid levels.  How are insurance companies offsetting half a trillion dollars in U.S. death/hospital claims alone on the books?  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) released a report in 2021 titled "Insurance Linked Securities". (ILS)  Oh yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like.  https://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_insurancelinked_securities.htm  Any of that sound familiar?  In 2019 ILS issuance was at an all time (20 years) high, with Q4 being 50% above the 10 year average. While conveniently close to the start of the pandemic, this may have had more to do with the Affordable Care Act loading insurance company balance sheets with the health care equivalent of sub prime mortgages.  If I read that report right, mortgages had started to find their way into these catastrophe bonds, right as businesses were closing, people were losing their jobs, leases and home loans were at risk of default.  I really hope I'm wrong, but catastrophe bonds being a catalyst for a financial catastrophe would be rather ironic.

It sounds like a Groucho Marx joke, of the "Who's buried in Grant's tomb?" variety. But the story behind the invention of the printing press, and the first book ever printed, is riddled with intrigue, subterfuge, and mystery. Let's start by finding out more about who Gutenberg really was.  **The grifter**   For one thing, Johannes Gutenberg was not a nice person. He was secretive and paranoid. He peddled strange and wacky schemes and was always trying to borrow money. Based on what few public records exist concerning his early adulthood, he could easily fit today's well-known stereotype of the entrepreneur con man: Ready to paint glorious pictures of the things he could create, if only you front him some cash.  He was sued by business partners. He was sued by creditors. He was sued for back tax money. In 1436, he was sued by a woman for "a breach of promise." These are the most concrete records that can be found for most of Gutenberg's adult life.  There are no records at all of his birth or his death, and during his lifetime he was never an important enough man for anyone to create a portrait of him. The several "portraits" of him that you can find floating around the internet, including the one on Wikipedia, are imaginative sketches concocted by artists who wanted to honor him, usually more than a hundred years after his death. These portraits are artistic fantasies.  He was probably brilliant, in a technical way. But his invention was no ideological flight of fancy. By the 1430s, Europe was already straining under the demand of increased literacy and increasing costs of scribes and workmen.  The technique of "block printing" was well-known at the time: A page of text could be carved into a block of wood and then used to create multiple copies of a page over and over again. This had been used in Asia for hundreds of years, and some publishers in Europe tried to use it for books.  It was, however, inefficient. It took a lot of effort to carve out a page of a book onto a block of wood, and unless a very large number of copies were to be printed, it barely seemed worth the cost: Each block of wood became useless when printing was done.  So Gutenberg was not, in fact, some kind of ideological crusader who wanted to bring an opportunity for literacy to the common man. He was just your typical broke entrepreneur with a get-rich-quick scheme.  **The crooked investor**   But even get-rich-quick schemes need funding. Throughout the 1440s, Gutenberg tinkered with his idea. Most of it was done in secrecy, because he was increasingly paranoid that someone would steal it from him. As a result, it's impossible for us to know the steps of trial and error he went through, or how his ideas evolved.  We do know that by the end of it all, he had a great number of technical achievements. Ultimately, he invented not only the actual letters themselves and the design of the typeface, but the mechanics of the box to hold letters, the press to hold the paper against the typeface, and even the ink that was used by the press. He truly did have a creative technical mind.  We also know, however, that by 1450 his money ran out. He persuaded a wealthy lawyer, Johann Fust, whom today we might call an "angel investor", to loan him 800 guilders (a lot of money: Enough to buy several small farms) to set up a shop, and 300 guilders per year for operation. In 1452, records show that Fust loaned Gutenberg another 800 guilders.  The money was spent wisely: Gutenberg indeed produced a printing press with moveable type. He decided that his first book, designed to display this technology to the world, would be the Bible. This was not thanks to any spiritual inspiration or religious zeal; he simply thought it would make the most money. Thus, at some point between 1452 and 1455, the printing of all 1,286 pages of what we now call "the Gutenberg Bible" was completed.  Early documentation states that a total of 200 copies were scheduled to be printed on rag cotton linen paper, and 30 copies on velum animal skin. It is not known exactly how many copies were actually printed.  **However, in November of 1455, before the Bible was actually sold or made any money, Johann Fust turned around and sued Gutenberg for unpaid loans plus interest: A grand total of 2026 guilders. Fust forced Gutenberg into bankruptcy, acquired the entire print shop — including the printing press — in the court settlement, and ousted Gutenberg into the streets.**  The Bible, of course, was still put to market by Fust. Although Gutenberg had successfully invented the printing press, he did not, unfortunately, invent the Copyright Page. Thus the name "Gutenberg" appears nowhere on the so-called "Gutenberg Bible".  Johann Fust, moreover, was not over-eager to bring up Gutenberg's name at parties. Instead, Fust hired Peter Schoeffer, who had been working as Gutenberg's foreman and therefore had all of the technical expertise to run Gutenberg's entire printing press operation. Together they ran quite a successful printing operation for many years to come, and made quite a lot of money. Peter Schoeffer even married Johann Fust's daughter, effectively making the printing press a family business.  In case you have any doubt that Fust and Schoeffer intended to take full and exclusive credit for the invention of the printing press, in 1457 they published a book of The Psalms, and with it included a publisher's note with the following text:  &gt;The present copy of the Psalms, adorned with beauty of capital letters, and sufficiently marked out with rubrics, has been thus fashioned by an ingenious invention of printing and stamping without any driving of the pen, and to the worship of God has been diligently brought to completion by Johann Fust, a citizen of Mainz, and Peter Schoffer of Gernsheim, in the year of the Lord 1457.  No mention of the existence of anyone named Gutenberg.  All of this might make you feel very sorry for Gutenberg, although you should keep in mind that people often reap what they sow. Looking back on his history, we cannot be certain how Gutenberg used all of the considerable funds that he was loaned for his project. Earlier records suggest that he was something of a grifter.  Some historians believe he may have been diverting funds to other ventures. So perhaps he only got what he deserved.  Johann Gutenberg died in Mainz, Germany, without record, although it must have happened some time in 1468. We know this only because that is when a physician named Konrad Humery sued for the deceased's possessions as repayment of debts owed.  He never profited from his invention, and died in poverty. He was buried in a Franciscan church, which was demolished and replaced with another church.  Which was later also demolished.  **The arc of history**   It wasn't until almost 100 years after Gutenberg's death that he was identified as the inventor of the printing press in a book on Germanic history. Over time, his reputation grew wildly. For hundreds of years, he was written about as though he were single-handedly responsible for everything from literacy in Europe to the Protestant Reformation.  But all good names must come to an end, in the face of culturally-sensitive historians. The fads and fashions of political correctness and revisionist histories have once again tried to punt poor Gutenberg back into obscurity.  Today, a quick search on the web can produce essays that describe Gutenberg as a mere technician in what was rightfully Fust and Schoeffer's business, and essays that angrily exclaim that none of these Europeans should get credit for anything because the Koreans invented moveable type in the year 1234.  Of course, by now the name Gutenberg has effectively carved its place in history, no matter how shady and convoluted the true historical record might be. Perhaps it can be taken as a morality tale for inventors or entrepreneurs, on the dangers of taking loans from shady investors.  Or perhaps a lesson for grifters: That even if you die penniless, you never know how history will remember you.

Am I just missing how if these companies paid appropriate \[not insane amounts, appropriate amounts\] taxes, the economy never had to tank at all?  And if companies not releasing products so they could claim higher prices due to ‘supply issues’  which causes the CPI to increase and inflation to rise, when inflation apparently doesn’t have to be as high as it is, now that supply issues are going to be less of a problem, is inflation going to ease a little? I’m not saying disappear because that’s not realistic but does it really need to be this high when there were artificial factors influencing it to go higher?  These are genuine questions, I’m not trying to be smart, I’m not all that smart.  I hope you all have a great weekend.

China Attacks Taiwan, Iran gets Nukes and NATO gets Involved/ WWIII.  I believe #2 is the most probable but who the fuck knows, I never expected what has happened so far to actually go down. This is also a terrible place for the market to be no matter how good today's rally felt. The fed still has a 8.9$ Trillion balance sheet and rates are still going to go up. Inflation is also here to stay since the fed is really not going to raise rates enough to make real rates negative.  So yeah time to hide in commodities till shit cools down.
439	1	Hello WSB!  Current earnings season have been sending stocks +/- 20% if they beat/miss (market cap under \~$15B from my observations).  And naked Call/Put options at least 20% from strike price usually goes up more than 100% if it hits it - so my question/thought is this:  **Does it makes sense to buy naked Call/Put options expiring on the same week of the earning call for the same $ amount on both side?** b/c if one direction is good, it will cover your loss with still handsome profit.  For example, see the image: if single/naked option is bought when $RUN was trading at $19 or $20 with +/- $5 from strike price, in this case I'd buy strike $25 CALL worth $1000 (to keep the math simple) and buy $15 PUT worth of $1000. You can see that $25 CALL option jumped 300% (my $1K is now $4K!) and I lost 55% on the $15 PUT side (which is 550 from initial $1K) and my net profit for the day would have been $2,450.   Has anyone tried this? I've just observing at this point, still new to Options trading and curious if there's a better way to play to maximize profit.
347	1	If you look at Putin’s history outside of the political realm most will quickly point to his tenure as a KGB officer. Clearly his experiences and skills gained there have not gone down the drain when you think about the timing of his attack: Global economy is just about to recover, the US trying to take steps to avoid inflation while avoiding the risk of recession, etc etc. And in all of that he decided to attack Ukraine when in reality he could’ve done it at any time. Now the markets are back on their sharp downhill slide, energy prices are soaring once again as sanctions continue to isolate Russia, and inflation is on track for another 0.5% increase with the price of oil/barrel going up $10 from $100 to $110…which means a more aggressive rate hike schedule from the Feds which increases the risk of recession.   People think this war with Ukraine is just about land and restoring former Russian glory from an angry old man. Truth is whatever you think of Putin is more than likely an underestimation of his true goals.   NATO sanctions isolating Russia from the rest of the world only means lack of information on Russian agendas for everyone else. We cut them off and give them the chance to reposition their economy while the rest of the world suffers from Russian aggression. Ukraine and it’s all it’s after shocks are just an opportunity for Russia to control the commodities again and reposition their economy to be self sufficient. How does this get accomplished? By dragging out a conflict. Winning or losing Ukraine isn’t the main objective. Sure the Ruble might be imploding and rich Russians might be losing money but that only presents an opportunity to control and invest in the next big assets such as digital currency and control them someway somehow.  TLDR; Putin is a slimy bastard. Ukraine isn’t the main goal, the main goal is to beat the rest of the world in the race to control the next big global assets that put Russia ahead of all other countries while inflicting distracting economic damage elsewhere.

Because China is actually getting closer to Russia during this Ukraine conflict, not distancing themselves, like you would expect.   That's right, China actually saw Russia turn into a Haiti tier economy overnight and thought "Wow, that was retarded what they just did, let's become their friend so they can help us do the same retarded thing to Taiwan some day." Like imagine siding with a Russian Midget with a Napolean complex that can't even win a war over the entire earth.   So yea, enjoy those bags, you communist dickwads, maybe daddy Xi can give you a few thousand Rubles to use as tissues to wipe your tears if he asks his best friend Putin for some.   **TL:DR Literally all you "China will replace the USA" people are retarded.**

748	1	Disclosure: This post is mix between DD/Discussion.  Thesis: Global wheat trade is poised for trouble; thus, demand will outweigh supply and prices will increase if global tensions escalate to the tipping point. The exposure to wheat is through the $WEAT ETF. Look at how crude oil has responded to the developing crisis. Also, if you go look what at the price action of WEAT during the month following Russia's annexing of Crimea, it shot up 20% in less than a month and that debacle now seems minor to the scale of the ongoing issue.   Content: The tensions in Eastern Europe with Russia, Ukraine, the US and NATO are recent high and growing. Russia has amassed over 100k troops along the Ukraine border and China has reportedly made preparations to potentially invade Taiwan. If Russia makes any likely moves on Ukraine NATO has stated that there will be heavy sanctions like none seen before, and I would obviously assume likewise for China. China and Russia have been growing their political ties, and China was Russia's largest partner in trade this past year.  It turns out, Russia and China are among the top 3 in the world for producing wheat. I would imagine if tensions develop into conflict, any wheat trade on a global scale will be affected. Ukraine is also in the top 10 of wheat producing country, and surely they would be exporting less if conflict arises. US is major wheat producer and "[Food, Beverages, and Feed"](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/07/news/economy/top-us-exports/index.html) is one of the largest US export categories. If Russia and China stop exporting to NATO allies or NATO sympathetic nations and Ukraine is unable to export wheat during conflict then I would imagine the demand for wheat globally will rise and supply will shorten.  Russia has also recently put a ban on exporting ammonium nitrate. Two crops that need a lot of ammonium nitrate (key ingredient in fertilizer) corn and WHEAT. Fertilizers also use ammonia, and ammonia production is coupled with gas prices - which are also rising among tensions in Eastern Europe.  Some links to these points: [https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/02/03/2158119/philippines-talks-china-fertilizer-imports](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/02/03/2158119/philippines-talks-china-fertilizer-imports)  [https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/agriculture/020222-russia-bans-ammonium-nitrate-exports-until-april-to-support-domestic-farmers](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/agriculture/020222-russia-bans-ammonium-nitrate-exports-until-april-to-support-domestic-farmers)  China leads the world in fertilizer production. Russia in 4th and US making half of what China produces.  With the Olympics set to start, I would say nothing will likely rise to the level of an actual, physical conflict until the Olympics is over, that take is speculative but it makes sense. But that would make right now the time to look at call options for the $WEAT ETF and the furthest date out available for my brokerage app is mid-July. And OTM calls are dirt cheap.  A key issue though is that I have found little exposure to such a commodity/market that is readily available to retail investors. The only ETF I have found is $WEAT and quite frankly its ties to wheat commodity contracts in Chicago is a bit hard to follow and would love some clarification if anyone knows this logistics of it. All opinions welcome.

I know that the Russian indeces plunged about 50% or some shit but i don't think that these bad news are priced in. I think 0 DTE puts on russia is the play for monday.
626	0	I've got myself a nice collection of promising, risky, usually under performing stocks. Once in a while one of them goes crazy. I cash it out completely if the gain is just around 100%, if over 200% I liquidate half, and keep the other half in hope of an even better future. So far it seems to be working.
333	0	So I (F20) bought some Yoga Pants from Lulu Lemon today and naturally I modelled them for my BF (M26). He said that while he loved the way they looked on me, he was also thankful that I was increasing his wealth. I was confused so he told me that he owns about $33,000 in Lulu Lemon stock.   I was even more intrigued. He told me that nearing the end of his time in undergrad, early 2018; he was going through an incel phase. This surprised me considering that well he is not that kind of person persoanlity wise. Even if it is all looks, which I doubt, he does not look ugly at all. Anyway, he was angered and depressed and hateful about lack of romantic success. He also bought into the dual mating thingy and it angered him.   He wanted revenge. But he didn't want to go scorched earth; he wanted to be productive. So he decided that he would get his revenge by winning. Now he already was on track to being and educated professional but he wanted his win to be more direct. He doubled down academically and professionally and channelled his anger towards "winning" and "one-upping" whomever rejected him. But that wasn't enough so he decided to get into investing and focus heavily on what he described then as "slutwear". He felt that instead of being mad at "Stacies" he would use capitalism as a tool to profit from them. He would focus on buying stock in companeis like Lululemon and Aritza so whenever the "Stacies" would spend money he would profit from them. Since "Stacies" also disproportionately work at those companies, he would also profit from the "exploitiation of their labour" (yes he is quite socialist).   Seeing his wealth go up explicity from "Stacies throwing their money away" made him feel better. And yes I do think was being petty and distasteful. But in terms of revenge ideas go this was pretty tame. He did not harm anyone, he just decided to benefit from an already "exploitive system" against his targests to increase his wealth. I thought that that was creative. And that and his general desire to win by doubling down on career and education genuinely made him a better, more desirable person. Seems like a Win-Win to me.

978	0	Malls were dead. MMs and SHFs started creating swap baskets of retail stores and shorting them around 2016sh. They also made retail ETFs to make the share creation/ shorting of these fine establishments easier. Bam. Enter a shf retart by the name of Plotkins who doubles down trying to short GME into the ground around 2018ish. Woulda gotta away with those sweet underpriced bankrupcy bankruptcy assets, if it wasn't for the meddling Fed fucking up everyone's put play in 2020.   #Daddy J Pow threw money at everything n everyone and markets boomed. What should have been a good time  getting rich off a dying retail sector became a nightmare to control all the different swap positions.#   And then (probably unknowingly to them) the **one Retart who uncontrollably shorted a stock** that was in all those baskets, was found out by many other retarts and the squeeze was on...   Thing is even though they contained it a year ago, they have to keep fighting to contain it every quarter because it's still in all those baskets. That's why XRT runs in cycles with GME. Plotkins shorted it far to much to close out the position. It's a fucking nightmare for them. **The best they can do is slowly unwind the position while discrediting and distracting from their mess by labling the shorted retail stocks as "meme" stocks.**   If you buy calls a few months out you can make money off these cycles. And with the crazed fan base holding the floor, direct registering the stock- taking it out of ciculation,*you get a highly illiquid situation that is set to blow the moment MM lose control of price suppression.* Why not have some insurance on the off hand MOASS happens?
681	1	Hi apes and retards, I wanted to share a method I have used to take a $25k account and turn it into $750k. This is not financial advice, but was hoping it might be useful to some of you out there posting massive loss porn and blown up accounts.   Step 1: Deposit $25k into trading account. Find your edge day trading, swing trading, low DTE weeklies trading, scalping, etc.   Step 2: Start out by risking no more than 3% of your account on any given trade. Ensure you take profits at predetermined targets and reduce position of trade going your way and set stop losses no higher than 5% from entry.   Step 3: Execute a couple great trades and double your account in 2 months. Then become completely cocky and through all your trading rules out the window and start risking 50% plus account size on retarded trades.   Step 4: Either win a big trade like this and get ready to lose more or lose a trade and start chasing even riskier trades. Blow up your account.   Step 5: Deposit $750k into trading account.   Hope this is useful!

We buy out all different brands starting from the cheap ones. Now it’s oil we’re talking about. Oil is the new TP. Oil ties with war and politics. Shares of oils will be pricey. I don’t care what brand it is but it’ll start from cheap brands first. 😂

587	1	   1. QE will continue until their March 15-16 meeting. A couple of members expressed their desire to end asset purchases ahead of schedule to send a strong message that the Federal Reserve is ready to combat inflation but the idea is not shared among the vast majority of members. 2. They will use interest rate hikes as main tools for monetary policy and a rate hike in March is appropriate. No mention on scale of rate hike or probability of inter-meeting rate hikes. 3. As per rate of interest rate hikes, most participants think that a faster rate of increases than in the post 2015 period is warranted due to GDP growth outlook and inflation pressures. If inflation proves to be more stubborn than anticipated, they are open to stepping up rate hikes. 4. As per QT, they will formalize a strategy in later meetings. As of right now, some participants think that best course of action is to sell MBS but not long term treasuries. Others also stated that a large portion of their balance sheet can also be unwinded naturally as the securities reach maturity. As per timing of QT, a number of participants think it is appropriate to unwind the balance sheet sometime later this year. 5. In terms of inflation, they acknowledged that inflation remains well above their forecasts and they revised upwards their short term PCE projections in December to reflect supply chain constraints. Despite this, they see little evidence to suggest that long term inflation will remain at such elevated levels over their 2% target. Because of this, the committee projects PCE will end 2022 at 2.6% due mostly to easing supply chain constraints and a decrease in energy costs. PCE is also forecasted to go to 2% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. 6. As per asset valuations they mentioned S&amp;P forward PE ratio near higher end and a few members believe this can prove to be an issue, particularly with the extremely accomodative monetary policy. A few participants also expressed concern of the rapid rise of cryptocurrencies and other highly speculative asset classes as well as decentralized financial systems and the threats they can pose on the economy if left unchecked. Some think that the economy is fundamentally strong enough to take a large painful correction but a couple are not so sure since a drastic decrease in asset prices can damage economic recovery. Overall, asset prices are not heavily discussed.
831	0	hi everyone. I love WSB. WSB is where I first found my identity as a content creator in May 2020, when I started to write essays about pandemic economics and hyper bullish investments like Cloudflare. There were many signs that I was becoming a content creator.  i've since stopped writing for WSB due to issues with automoderation and ended up amassing a following of 50,000 since then &amp; I'm in the process of rewriting my essays into a cohesive book about post-pandemic economics.   One of these essays is on the Metaverse, and I consider Reddit to be the frontier of the real Metaverse.   Please mods, hear me out. You are important and your choices matter:  1. Allow us to talk about alternative currencies 2. Allow us to post memes, they are one of the most powerful forms of communication. At the very least, on the weekends. 3. Continue to make difficult choices. Success is guarunteed when there is a lack of consensus.
101	1	So. I don't know stocks. Period, bar none. I'm dumb. I don't know how the overleveraging thing worked, I don't know how GSE worked.   What I do know is that removing a nuclear superpower from SWIFT is a big move. And that every move after is a bet on what way the wind blows after. Major banking firms, Microsoft, Oracle...they made a decision between weathering the storm and a few months of bad publicity and leaving a lot of cash and gear on the table, or cutting out and dealing with what comes next.  Simply put, even if I don't know the minutae, I know that you don't make a move without reading the analysis and deciding it's worth your time. Deciding that the goodwill, public feedback, government interaction, whatever, is worth it.   The Pinto didn't stay on the market because Ford was cheap. It stayed their because the cost wasn't worth it until they got exposed, right?  Same too with leaving a major market that itself is a top-run government. And doing so in a way that if the current powers that be stay so, you burnt that bridge.  So. Why is Koch staying there? Why is a business with 115 bil in revenue, 122k employees, keeping a business that's only 6k there?  Option one is that they wanna weather the storm, which is valid. Ideological reasons blah blah.  Option two is that they can't afford to leave.  Can someone better than me look at positions and junk for Koch or for Guardian Industries? Feels like it's weird here. Some thing not right.
355	1	Just posting an update on where I see RKT in the next three days. You angry bastards can look up JPows skirt and anywhere other than this post Idc.  Also, I don't claim to know jack shit.   So obvious past information. 1 Year ago Rocket Companies announced a 1.01 Special Dividend. This caused a rush, which then lead to a short squeeze, and then ended with a Gamma squeeze. This literally RKT's the Share price from 20 - 45$ EOD 3/2/21   I rode that ballistic missile and made a shit pot of cash, I posted a couple days back.   Well long story short, RKT announced another Special dividend. The SP at the time of annoucement was 10 pitiful dollars. Roughly a 10 percent return for holding through DIVI date this upcoming 3/8/22.  Do I think we are in for a similar rise? No. Do I think interesting action could happen? Yes. Is alot of this led by Nostalgia? Absolutely.   RKT has always been a volatile stock. Its considered a 'meme' stock by most even though this company prints money like the US FED.   Anyways I'm not here to bore you degens. Just pointing out some interesting metrics to keep an eye out for....  So, Float currently sits around 125 million shares. Short interest(If all is true) is 14 percent of float, with 2 days to cover.  https://preview.redd.it/mjv9znz1vvk81.jpg?width=755&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db692bc888b2d5b50d97f0d237ad71844a1833c5  Since the DIVI announcement shares have risen roughly 16 percent. RKT today climbed based resistance at 13.25 and closed the day at 13.40.   Where I think things will get interesting is at 13.50 Option interest is highest at 13.50 with with volume on those calls of 13,083. If we cross that then I think boosters will start to engage. People will be coming in already for the free 1.01 per share. Shorts wont have as much ammo unless they want to pay the fees and DIVI.   Calls are dirt cheap. Dirt cheap.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/199nw16wtvk81.jpg?width=1373&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd2519d0d4da980bae322938c249373a6b8e4177  Shorts wont want to pay the Dividend and fees, I think this will add buy pressure as they close before the capture date on 3/8.  This movement has caused RKT to break its downtrend. Now the 5EMA crossed the 13 EMA and 20EMA. (Who the shit knows what that means?)  Second to last point. Meme season is back? Thank you.  and finally my most important point.  https://preview.redd.it/m9xh41pgvvk81.jpg?width=708&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e22543f170a63db8829fe6ff2cfa348e3f74cbf  &amp;#x200B;  I have no idea if this hoe will pop off, but due to the nostalgia......I'm betting. Small, but still betting.   Tomorrow is 3/2/22 Exactly one year later...Lets see if RKT really deserves its name twice.  Small position - [https://imgur.com/a/fvMoUeV](https://imgur.com/a/fvMoUeV)

From some hippy/witchcraft website:   ## Why do new moons happen again?  A new moon happens once a month when the moon and the sun conjoin in the sky, setting off a new cycle of light. When the moon is new, it's invisible to us on Earth, then it slowly appears as a very thin crescent of light. While the energy of a new moon lasts for about three days before and after the lunation, the moon is technically only new for a moment—when the sun and the moon are directly aligned in the sky  The new moon is a time to set intentions and launch new projects. Since new moons happen once a month and signify the beginning of a cycle, you can think of them as a cosmic reset. The new moon is an ideal time to [set intentions](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-16947/10-intentions-to-set-for-your-most-authentic-life.html) and goals that you'll develop as the moon waxes toward fullness. Connecting to these lunar energies can provide grounding and a sense of direction (which a lot of your retards need)  Our mission during this time is to collect energy and information as everything becomes illuminated. We can use the waxing moon momentum for building, working toward a goal (like getting rid of your wife's bf or to stop jerking off), or bringing the first phases of a project to fruition.   ## What to do during the new moon:  ### 1. Write down your intentions.  When we write things down, we are more likely to remember and act on them. At a page-turning new moon, write down whatever you're looking to [manifest](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-16150/9-habits-to-manifest-your-dreams-using-the-law-of-attraction.html) during this two-week cycle of light. Spend time with what you wrote and read it aloud. Keep your list of intentions with you as the moon waxes, and revisit it and revise it as needed. Stay in tune with the moon as it builds, and manifest your desires.  ### 2. Choose an affirmation.  What kind of energy do you want to bring with you into this new cycle? Affirmations are a great way to get clear on what you want. Make [a list of affirmations](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-4152/8-Positive-Affirmations-for-Optimal-Health.html), read them aloud, and revisit them as the moon's light builds. Whereas intentions set the tone for what you want to *do*, affirmations are all about what you want to *be and embody.* Examples of affirmations for the new moon include: "I am confident"; "I bring peace and love into this new cycle of light"; "I share my light."  ### 3. Take a new moon refresher bath.  Water-based rituals are always a great way to work with lunar energy, as the moon is so closely linked with the water element. Relax and reset in the tub with your favorite music playing. Light candles, [fill your diffuser with essential oils](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/essential-oil-diffusion-101), and set a healing ambience for your bath. Submerge and set the space for a new beginning as you cleanse, release, and refresh your mind, body, and spirit.  ### 4. Create sacred space.  Creating sacred, intentional space is an excellent way to invite new moon energy into your life. Oftentimes, when we create a physical environment, the energy we want more readily pours into our lives. Clear off a surface (dresser, table, etc.) and set any objects, intentions, lists, or images that remind you of what you're calling in with the new moon. Revisit this sacred space as the moon waxes. You can use it as a meditation station and light candles, use aromatherapy and oils, [add crystals](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-23590/8-lesserknown-ways-to-use-crystals-in-your-everyday-routine.html), and ground into the energy around the space every morning. New moons can also be a time to share sacred space with others through a [new moon circle ceremony](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-23725/how-to-harness-the-power-of-tonights-sky-with-a-new-moon-circle.html).  ## What NOT to do during the new moon:  ### 1. Spend time with naysayers.  Use the new moon to energetically set the tone for the coming weeks. It's a time to refresh, reset, and look to the future. If there are any relationships or friendships in your life that consistently bring you down or drain your energy, you'll want to avoid spending time with these people at the new moon. Surround yourself with people who help you feel energized and alive!  ### 2. Get stuck in the past.  The new moon is just that: new! Stay present, look ahead to the future with optimism, and try not to get bogged down with worries about the past. Let it go, and let it flow.  3. Say no to new opportunities, people, or experiences.  Pay special attention to any new people, experiences, or opportunities that the universe puts in your path during the new moon. While the full moon is a time to release anything that's not serving us, the new moon is a time to build, create, and spark new projects.   Thanks for reading,  NightMan
521	0	Hi degens,  My portfolio has taken a big hit since November 2021 and I'm down **more than** $180k (between realized and unrealized losses). I feel really bad about it and hate myself for putting myself through this. I could have stuck to bluechips or indexes and come out much ahead but I chose to get into growth stocks in November after which they have been on a constant downfall (cue the "it fell because you bought" comments) - think ROKU, PYPL etc.  &amp;#x200B;  It feels worse because beginning of 2021 was such a great time for me (till mid-Feb), was making all the right calls day trading and making a ton of money. Lately I'm seeing a few friends buy houses, cars, splurging on stuff and I feel terrible about not being able to do so. When others were buying all that I was putting my $ in the market in the hopes that I will be able to make bigger purchases later (not for bragging but just what I like), now all that is down the drain. I feel like a loser.   &amp;#x200B;  Please help me. How can I get over this? This is real weighing me down and not able to focus on work, I don't want it to cause a double whammy.
637	0	Back in mid December 2021 after the fed meeting the market had a rally, all my heavey tech based positions (all in blue chip tech, with no investments in ballooned uniform companies) recovered from the minor dip of November caused by omicron, from the meeting my takeaway was that the market will get oversold early 2022. I’ve then asked advice from a friend a trust with over 30 years of trading and his feedback was that worse case scenario is a 10-15% correction early 2022. I really wanted to liquidate and sit on cash to buy the real dip and avoid loosing my 20% gain from 2021. In the matter of 2 weeks early January I lost that 20% gain and lost 15% of my overall portfolio, out of dispersion I liquidated 30% of my overall positions and started betting on semis( due to the shortages a real opportunity is here) prior to their earnings with the 30% of my overall portfolio, this then did not go as planned and here’s how it went.   ASML: lost 3 % on the 30% which is roughly 1.5% gain of overall portfolio AMD: Made 13% on 20% of overall portfolio, roughly 2.5%  GOOG: thought would have a solid quarter so 10% of portfolio was invested sold at 9% uptrend with .9% gain  FB: with 13.5 % of overall portfolio invested through buying its dips took a hit at earnings, devastating to my overall portfolio with a 6% net loss on overall portfolio.  QCOMM: invested 10% of portfolio and lost 2% post earnings.   Here’s where shit starts ( continued on earnings plays )   I shorted Zillow and it rallied.. (shorted more at peak of rally)  bought CLF and it tanked..  Next moves:   NVDA 30% of overall portfolio  This is not financial advice, but to get insight from fellas who want to make money.   Disclaimer: I’ll try to reply to all serious comments and will ignore shit posts
175	1	Ayo...Gold Standard Idiots, why do you want to buy shit by trading hogsheads of brandy and sheaves of wheat and barbells of salted foreskins?   Every fucking gram of gold ever mined could be in Fort Knox and we would still need a fiat currency because the size of the market you fucking morons There is 8-12 trillion in gold in existence. The US stock market alone (not even the entire economy you tard) has a market cap of 93 trillion. How exactly are people going to pay for a sandwich using a gold backed currency when there will only be 12 trillion dollars in existence? Oh... That's right, we'll do what people did when we had a gold standard- we'll trade shit because we can't find any actual currency to spend. But here's my dilemma, how am I going to gamble on the stock market whem my broker doesn't accept pickled pigs testicles or pillows made from body hair as currency?

826	1	1) Rivian is treated as "marketable securities" on Ford's balance sheet, as opposed to "long term investments". This means Ford has no intentions to hold Rivian for the long haul. In fact on slight 20 of Ford's Q4 Earnings presentation, it categorize its Rivian holdings worth $10.6B as "Liquidity". We know a company's liquidity needs to be reliable and readily available in time of need. Holding Rivian shares is not the best way to maintain this liquidity.  2) During the earning call, analyst from JPM asked about what Ford will do with its high cash balance at $36.5B and whether Ford will sell its Rivian stake. Company said there are opportunities for acquisitions in the EV supply-chain. Given current elevated valuations for EV-related targets, Ford will certainly need to put up cash in the billions for a potential acquisition. More the reason it will sell Rivian shares to generate cash.  3) Also the company flat out ignored the analyst's question about its Rivian stake and immediately moved on to the next question. If Ford is confident in its Rivian investment, it will surely comment positively on any future collaborations or Rivian's long-term prospects. It didn't. By ignoring the question, the company is saying its answer to the first half the question also applies to its Rivian stake, i.e. need to use cash for acquisition.   Ford owns around 100M shares ($10.6B/$103.69 on 12/31/2021) or 11% of total shares outstanding, imagine if they come out and say they will sell Rivian when lockup expires in May 2022, this overhang will scare current holders into selling before then driving down the value of its Rivian stake. (The $10.6B stake already dropped to $6.6B since the end of last year.)

222	1	&amp;#x200B;  Just the name *Ford Lightning* does something to my American DNA by putting hair on my chest. My doctor has warned me about high cholesterol, my psychiatrist about the mega lottery environment of this sub, and my dealer about fake Sinaloa chalk. But most importantly, a friend of mine, an autist, has warned me about the EV startups. Specifically the SPAC EV start-ups, like RIDE. His rosacea beams when he talks about them, his voice booming with an authority that makes FOMO unavoidable. I found him last Saturday where he usually is in Sapphire (Times Square location). He wanted to talk about his investment newsletter he’s about to start putting out while a piece of Cuban meat ground expertly on him, contaminating our space with what I learned was an essence called Warm Vanilla, by Bath &amp; Body Works. I pressed him on which EV to short and how to do it. He slapped the Cuban’s ass and instantly appeared an enormous square-shaped bouncer from the shadow warning him. Normally this will get you thrown out, but he greases the place like the lesser Biden did Ukraine. Anyway, my friend became functional, getting his shit under control and staring at me. This was rare though, as he can hardly maintain eye contact. But it was dark enough, and he gets Bolivian marching powder from the same cats that sell to the anorexic towers overlooking Central Park, the half empty ones owned by a dozen shells working back to a czar colluding to replace Putin before he’s Grand Dragon of Finland and Arch Duke of Ukraine.   “You sell a call at strike price A,” he said, “Then you buy a put at stake price A.”  I thought about it a moment. “Isn’t that the equivalent of just shorting the stock?”  He laughed at me but was staring in the Cuban’s eyes. “The margin requirement is far less, way less.”  It’s amazing when stupid simple things like that get overlooked. With this strategy I can short RIDE to bankruptcy which will happen later this year and have enough money for violent YOLO’s as circumstances demand in what’s certain to be a volatile trader’s market. The autist explained the importance of lasers in the manufacture of semiconductors and modern batteries. He took a veiled shot at me claiming I’m familiar with neon at the liquor store I frequent, but neon gas is necessary for these lasers. He says Ukraine effectively exports all the world’s neon for these, and with the conflict, it’s pretty much over without Obama-style bailouts with Trump-sized denials. He calls shorting these EV’s a millionaire maker and that they’ve already enjoyed their stonk and meme gasps.   “Now it’s time for them to get undressed by the buzzards.”   The FOMO this guy writes into me is like the bank robbery scene in the movie Heat. But suddenly the meat spoke, she said something interesting while we were briefly talking about Russia, her pleasing boobs rattling with each syllable:  “Cubans don’t want their grandpa’s revolution, they want jobs. Putin no understand generational divide. Nobody cares about or wants their parent’s Soviet Union. Is gone. Culture change. World change. Globalization. Interdependent...”  The lecherous Patrick Bateman inside us all would’ve paid anything to smash this meat and leave it for dead. Trust me. Anything at all. NYC strippers are amazing, smart, cognizant creatures. Someday I want to get a list of all the old Harvey Weinstein haunts and try figuring out if they had anything to do with him shafting Saving Private Ryan from getting best picture in 1999. Anyway, knowing I’d be looking to make up for blue balls with another dancer in the Sapphire’s employ, I quickly left. I rode my bike back to Brooklyn, and in my apartment searched r/wallstreetbets for anyone of the same mind as my autist. All I found were degen bulls buying calls and refusing to admit they’re trying to make up for missing out on TSLA.

78	1	#  An Analysis of $RBLX  By a trader who eats crayons  # Section 1: What is $RBLX  $RBLX is the stock for popular gaming company Roblox. Roblox itself is a massive gaming company that focuses on younger children and teenagers, although has an audience on all scales. Roblox belongs in the Communication Services sector within the Electronic Gaming industry, joining the likes of $ATVI and $NTES. Roblox makes the majority of its money through transactions for its in-game currency (known as Robux), advertising deals &amp; collaborations (like the partnership with Gucci), and licensing agreements.  Although Roblox itself is old, made in September 1, 2016, its stock is fairly new to the market, opening on March 10, 2021.  # Section 2: $RBLX Stock Summary  Although $RBLX’s market cap evaluation varies from website, doing quick math with its current price ($49.69 nice) results in a strong market cap of $30.26B. However, it is important to keep in mind that $RBLX suffers from an EPS of $-0.97. Although $RBLX holds a debt of $1.18B, it makes up for it for holding $3B in cash, leaving a total excess of $1.82B. It is also important to know that, although $RBLX’s revenue is strongly increasing, its actual earnings are decreasing. Here is some extra info on $RBLX (All info is based on Q4 2021 and extracted from Yahoo Finance):  EV: $21.29B  EV/EBITDA: -493.05   EV/Revenue: 103.31  P/B: 100.57  # Section 3: Why $RBLX is a Good Buy  Looking at $RBLX from a purely financial perspective, it might not be the best there is. With a shitty EPS and horrid EV/EBITDA which stands near -500, $RBLX is definitely not for the weak. But we are not the weak, we are the retards. Now, let’s get to talking as to why $RBLX might even have a chance of recovering.   If anyone has been paying attention to $RBLX, they might have seen that it has gone from a low of $39 to $49. That’s a change of nearly 25%. In fact, just yesterday, $RBLX went up by 7%. Sure, it follows the NASDAQ and the NASDAQ went up by a lot, but $RBLX is severely under where it was just a month ago. Sure, $RBLX’s P/B might be way too high, but that doesn’t stop it from growing… that much anyways. Furthermore, with the announcement that Pelosi had bought calls on $RBLX just before they released their earnings report, of course there will be people trying to undermine her moves. $RBLX, prior to their Q4 2021 report, was standing at \~$70. Taking in the fact that one of their previous reports has done twice as bad and *that* only changed their stock value from $83 to $74.89, the only reasonable reason $RBLX went down the way it did on February 16 was due to increased news coverage.   Currently, the average price target for $RBLX is $71. There has been a huge increase in large-scale orders on $RBLX on 3/17 and 3/18 compared to the rest of this week. Many retards are predicting $55 by the end of next week, and a 10% increase might be on the lower end. With $RBLX getting more attention every day, actual investors might start to get into this stock.   Basically, to recap, $RBLX low. Low go up. Up mean tendies. Tendie good.   Hold on, I’m getting told by my lawyer that I’ve gotta add some legal shit or something, I don’t know.  “I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. If you think some guy who’s lost 25% of his portfolio worth in a week is right, you’re retarded. Even more retarded than the average WSB retard.”  &amp;#x200B;  Positions: None at the moment, just sold calls on Friday for a 1,000% Profit. Most likely will buy more calls on Monday
833	1	In this post I'll try to explain to you degens why Coinbase is actually a high growth tech company, and not some exchange that will become irrelevant in 3-5 years.   Let's ignore revenue from trading fees (89%) of Coinbase' revenue in Q3.  AND let's ignore the upcoming "expensive jpeg" (I know that's not the only use case, fuck off) marketplace.  Let's just focus on subscription &amp; services revenue, which made up the other 11% of revenue from Q3.  Here's what you need to know. the average quarter over quarter growth rate for their subscription and services revenue over the last 4 quarters is 97.34%.  Yes (in millions $, Q3'2020 - Q3'2021): 10.7 &gt; 20.7 &gt; 56.4 &gt; 102.6 &gt; 145.2.  Now, you might say, millions is nothing for a company with a $40B market cap. Why are we talking about this?  Here's why: Q3 posed 41.5% growth in S&amp;S revenue quarter over quarter, and this was during a "winter" where trading volumes were down 30% quarter over quarter. I propose that this means regardless of asset prices, institutions (primarily) are continuing to invest into this new asset class.   And that this category of revenue is going to CONTINUE to grow exponentially for the foreseeable future. Coinbase is the best positioned to serve the needs of existing institutional entities as well as startups that want to get involved in this space. And I see no competition coming.   Also, even if there was competition, guess what - Coinbase would probably be an investor, and probably acquire them. Their Venture arm has invested more than $26B in various "decentralized web technology companies in 2021)   Analysts are expecting Coinbase revenue &amp; earnings to decline substantially in 2022. I think for one thing, that Q4'2021 may surprise to the upside on higher than expected growth in the S&amp;S category of revenue (since trading volumes are public data, there's not much room for surprise).   Furthermore, I think that 2022 is going to be another explosive year of adoption in all aspects of this space.   We'll talk about valuations next. Now, we can't ignore revenue from trading fee's here. So keep that in mind. But I like to think of revenue from trading fees much like the tax credits Tesla received that made them profitable originally. They may be temporary, but they are giving the company a really strong financial foundation to stand on. But let's try to price this company based on the underlying growth, with the understanding that the balance sheet is exceptionally  healthy.   Given their Q3 S&amp;S revenue of $145M, up by \~1300% from Q3 of 2020... We'll to be honest, I started writing this section with the intent of proving they deserved a certain multiple, but I'm kinda retarded, so I'll leave that to somebody else. But I ASSERT that a P/E of \~16 (as it stands today) is too damn low. And - oh - by the way - after they report Q4 earnings it should be closer to 13.   Yes - If they have a record breaking quarter (they will), but, let's for simplicity assume they match Q2 (less the tax credit they cashed in Q2 which pumped their earnings \~$737M, and I might be missing something here but I'm doing the conservative thing) that would leave them with Q4 net income of $869M. Which would put their yearly EPS at $13.9. Which only edges out consensus to the upside by \~5%.   So if consensus is so on-the-nose, again, what are we talking about?  Well consensus is only coincidentally on the nose, because S&amp;S revenue is only ramping up. An extra $100M here or there doesn't mean a lot to Coinbase' earnings today. But by the end of 2022, they could be doing closer to $1B (roughly 4x on the +$200M I expect to see in Q4 earnings) in S&amp;S revenue each quarter. Do I know where the growth stops? no I do not. Which is why I'm bullish as fuck.  And again, analyst consensus is that Coinbase revenue declines in 2022 and beyond. I think there will be a tidal wave of price target raises somewhere between Q2 &amp; Q3 of this year.   All of this to say that in the face of overwhelming evidence, analysts will have to raise price targets and somewhere along the way, wall street will realize Coinbase is a high growth tech company that deserves a growth multiple. Revenue diversification isn't coming, it's here, and it's sneaking up on everybody who doesn't understand why Coinbase should be worth more than Nasdaq.   &amp;#x200B;  No TLDR for you. $505 C 1/20/2023.
313	1	Costco will moon sometime in the next year.   Inflation is driving people to buy in bulk. People fucking love Costco.   Here’s the magic event, Costco hasn’t raised membership dues since June 2017.   A quote from the CEO on recent earnings:  Mr. Galanti once again deferred on when Costco planned to increase membership fees. He said that the last three increases over the last 15 years came out to an increase every five and a half years, with the last increase happening in June 2017. "I think the question will continue to be asked until we do or don't do something. But at the end of the day we certainly feel good about our member loyalty, our success getting members to move to executive membership...you guys will know when we tell you and at some point it will happen," says Mr. Galanti.  5.5 years is 2023 and I think they will raise membership rates around mid year.   When they raise they will pop.   Long dated calls should print.
48	0	Hey fellow Apes and Monkey species.   Here is my DD for a banana genetics company.   I found a biotech company that is redesigning the banana. Banana can be used for scale. Can be used for food. It can be used as a bear or bull trap.   Bananas are the key to a good healthy diet while trading. It can be a smooth, a chip, a porridge, a cake. The dream of banana things are limitless. So therefore I am investing in the genetics of banana. I believe that investing in the genetics of banana and as part of the ape species it is my duty to do so.   Even if I get -100% in this banana stock. At least i know I tried to make a world a better place for my fellow ape and monkeys.   I believe in banana. Therefore as an ape it is my duty to invest in this.   Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk.
217	1	[https://risingcandle.com/business/hedge-funds-shorted-more-than-200b-worth-of-securities-ytd-margin-calls-on-the-horizon/](https://risingcandle.com/business/hedge-funds-shorted-more-than-200b-worth-of-securities-ytd-margin-calls-on-the-horizon/)  Hedge Funds have been selling stocks and have started covering their short positions to reduce risk in the current market condition. The equity market’s volatility index has begun to climb up, thanks to Omicron virus fears in early 2022, rising interest rates, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and fluctuating commodity prices.  Vix’s volatility index has almost doubled since the beginning of the year, and the trend is pointing upwards, suggesting the pain isn’t over yet.  Since the 2008 market crash, the only time Vix had gone above 50 points in the last 20 years was in March 2020 – due to Covid lockdowns. And looking into the 20-year data, usually when the volatility index spikes – a recession follows it.  With risk-exposure heightening and the stock market entering into a bearish trend, Hedge funds have been raking profits while retail investors suffered losses. Bloomberg reported that the data from Goldman Sachs suggests that the selling is at its highest rate since last year. On Tuesday, Nasdaq 100 officially closed into a ‘bearish market’ (a 20% drop from its all-time highs) following the second-worst daily selloff (-3.8%) in 18 months. Although it rose a staggering 3.59% on Wednesday, it’s still down -4% from Monday’s close.  But it’s not all happy days for Hedge funds yet. According to data from Morgan Stanley, Hedge funds that play on volatility and commodity trading advisors have sold over **$200B** worth of global equities since the beginning of the year. In simple terms – they have **oversold** (shorted) equities.  Recent disclosure from [Citadel Securities](https://risingcandle.com/business/citadels-short-sale-investments-rose-by-40-mn-in-2-years/), one of the biggest hedge funds, shed light on how deep hedge funds are in the shorting business. With $546M cash, Citadel Securities had $73B worth of securities in hand as of Dec 2021, totaling their asset value to $79.123B and a mind-blowing $65B (approx) worth of Securities sold (and not yet purchased in its fair value) totaling their liabilities to $74B.  The Reverse Repo chart indicates that borrowing has started reducing since February 25th, which directly correlates to the start of a market-wide selloff. Retail investors aren’t selling – Market makers and hedge funds are.

920	0	Cross post from personal finance  Hi Reddit,  Throwaway for obvious reasons; I'm coming to Reddit because I have nowhere else to turn to for advice.  While I am far from being even knowledgeable about the stock market, I will do my best to explain in detail what has happened.  My dad started trading stocks regularly in March 2020, when the pandemic hit. While my parents have kept their jobs, my dad is always someone who spends most of his time on side projects that have had varying degrees of success (but have not been very profitable for him), and I believe trading is his newest passion project.  My dad earned few thousand dollars trading before a short call went wrong sometime around April 2020. Here, he lost about $400,000, wiping out years of savings that my parents were likely holding for their retirement. After realizing his mistake, he promised to play safely in the stock market, and keep my mother (who is literate with stocks and does some trading herself) updated with his trades to make sure he didn’t go overboard any longer.  However, as he began to slowly earn his money back, he became more confident. Largely unbeknownst to my mother, he switched to placing short puts at very high leverage that paid off and quickly earned his losses back by the end of 2021. Now, I believe is when he began to feel invincible, to a sense: when my mom found out a few months ago, she pleaded for him to stop playing at such high-risk margins and to quit while he was ahead. However, because my dad was making his losses back, she wasn’t very aggressive. Instead, she remained a nervous wreck for the past few months. This ruined our home life during this time, as both my parents became consumed by constantly checking the market, alongside their full-time jobs, leaving no time for the rest of the family.  Unfortunately, my mom’s fears were realized as dad’s winning streak didn’t last. This past Friday (1/21), he placed a risky short put set for Monday (1/17). My mom was extremely worried over the weekend, given analysts' projections and the usual insane amount of leverage that my dad had on his trades.  As many of you likely have guessed, this didn’t end well for my dad. As the market tanked Monday, he realized that his trades had put him in the same hole he was in just 2 years ago, at a near half-million-dollar ($500,000) loss this time. Despite him lying to her about managing his risk, my mom agreed to forgive him (albeit after quite a bit of arguing) if he stopped trading altogether.  He has agreed to significantly reduce his portfolio to significantly reduce his risk, in order to have a higher amount of liquidation to handle further market turbulence.  Here’s the problem: my mom and I don’t fully believe him, or in him. As stated before, he has already lied about managing risk before this. While this is a step further than he was willing to go last time, neither of us know if he will increase his portfolio size again when he has gained some money back, or somehow lose hundreds of thousands by finding a new avenue of trading, even with a smaller portfolio. Despite earning well for themselves my parents cannot afford to keep losing like this, especially with them aging close to retirement age (mid 50s).  My mom has threatened divorce if my dad keeps trading, which I see as a fair option under the circumstances, as this has ruined her life for the past year or so (albeit she is extremely reluctant to), and she should try to financially protect herself. While he claims he values our family, I don’t see him stopping trading any time soon, as he "already has been through this once," claiming that “it would be stupid to exit the market right now, that’s what the hedge funds want so they can buy back in.”  I have tried pleading with my dad on my mother’s behalf, to no avail. I just want my parents to be happy and have a happy retirement. My mom is at the end of her rope, and both of us are out of ideas on how to appeal to my dad.  Are my mom and I being crazy? Is there a way that I can appeal to my dad? Is divorce a good idea for my mom?  If anyone actually read through all this. Thank you, even if you don’t have any advice to give.  Tl;dr dad won’t stop (fully) trading after gaining confidence despite losing a ton of money in the stock market after gaining confidence, despite pleading from our family.

Congrats! Now there’s potentially World War III to deal with. Damn it. If World War III does happen, we should learn how to prepare now. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does have the possibility of starting the next World War. Imagine. Belarus joins Russia in the war. NATO fights back. The West levies massive sanctions against Russia. China backs up Russia. China invades Taiwan. Then the U.S. finally steps up. If the U.S. gets heavily involved, then our citizens become at risk. Once a nuclear bomb hits America, billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg can retreat to over 700+ acres of now private Kauai land. He’s probably in Hawaii already. Even Mark’s buddy, Facebook ex-board member and early investor, Peter Thiel has a private jet gassed up and waiting to fly his family and friends to the most expensive place in the world, New Zealand, if World War III ensues. But what about the rest of us poor saps who can’t afford to buy out indigenous people or cough up $20,000 an hour for a 12-hour Gulfstream 650 flight across the world? Are we commoners screwed? Heck no! We must stand our ground and fight for our freedom as the ungodly rich flee our great nation! If we survive, we can then rebuild our own empires. In the process, we can confiscate the properties of those who fled and permanently ban them from returning home.  How To Prepare For World War III  Let’s hope we have a swift resolution to this latest war. However, just in case the world goes to hell, here are some things I’m planning on doing and so should you.  1) Be as fit as you were in high school.  Now is the time to stop making excuses about physical fitness. We had our chance to get fit during the pandemic, but now there’s World War 3 to deal with. If you’re overweight, it’s time to get back into tip top shape. It’s important to be as lean as possible when you’re chasing down or running away from an enemy combatant. I plan to make sure I can run three consecutive miles in 18 minutes or less. I’m only about two miles away from the ocean where I can take cover among the sea people. Make sure you are fit enough to run nonstop to your closest safe zone! And if not, get an electronic scooter. Here are two weight charts to see if you’re a healthy weight. If you’re not within the guidelines, then at least make sure you can complete the distance and time requirements. Remember, you don’t have to outrun an angry bear. You just need to outrun the person next to you. The least fit will suffer the greatest!  ￼Ideal Weight Chart For Women  ￼Ideal Weight Chart For Men  2) Reinforce your secret room (panic room).   Do you remember watching Wes Craven’s 1991 film, The People Under The Stairs? It’s as terrible as watching The Exorcist as a kid. Nightmares galore! You’ll learn from the movie that everybody should build a secret room so nobody can find them. If you don’t have a secret room, you must build one. If you can’t build one, then convert a crawl space, attic, or unassuming closet into one. After the air strikes are done, the ground strikes will begin. A secret room will help you hide from your oppressors.  Your secret room should have electrical outlets for a mini fridge, microwave, router, CCTV, laptop, and cell phone. You should be able to live in your secret room for at least a month to let any sort of nuclear radiation thin out a little. If your enemy is camped outside, the longer you can hold out, the higher your chance for survival as they move on to their next victims. Don’t forget to build a ventilation system and reinforce the entry way with steel rebar. The biggest risk to a secret room is that it gets discovered. Your enemies could smoke or burn you out, so consider having some type of anti-fire device, and definitely keep several oxygen masks as well. Anne Frank and her family began hiding on July 6, 1942 until they were betrayed and arrested on August 4, 1944. A secret annex will buy yourself time to find solutions. Please visit the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam if you are ever there. We must never forget the atrocities of war.  Examples of panic rooms for World War 3  A wonderful panic room 13 feet below the ground with private keycard access.  An efficient secret room that can house 6 uncomfortably  Ventilation is huge in case your enemies plan to smoke you out  Probably the best secret room entrance in the world  3) Train in hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms.  Now is the time to watch every single Youtube video there is about how to use a knife and a gun. Take classes in hand-to-hand combat as well. Focus on chopping the person’s throat, elbowing the solarplex, and kneeing the groin. If you can grab a hold of your assailant’s pinky, bend it backwards until it snaps. I studied martial arts for years growing up in Asia so don’t mess with me intruders! Further, as a softball slugger, I’m handy with using a bat. Time for everyone to brush up and get fierce!   4) Create an A-team to survive World War III.  If it’s just you and your family, it’s going to be harder to survive the war compared to a hoard of 60 heavily-armed militia. In order to build a team, you’ve got to make a pact before anything happens. That means reaching out to your nearby friends and sharing your contingency plan with them. Maybe they’ll think you’re crazy, but it’s always better to be safe than sorry. We created pandemic pods. We should create World War III A-teams. Don’t be that dumbass who connects over LinkedIn out of the blue when he wants something. You need to be maintaining relationships long before something bad happens!  If your house gets overrun, you need to be able to flee to a friend’s place. I have one friend who lives 2.5 miles away who has already built a panic room with a 6-inch reinforced steel door. The importance of being fit enough to run nonstop to your closest ally cannot be underestimated. The Financial Samurai A-Team will include any reader who has read since this site started in 2009, contributed at least 100 thoughtful comments, knows how to communicate and play well with others, and has skills in archery, camping, hand-to-hand combat, and critical reasoning.  5) Set up a proprietary communication system.  If either my wife or I am ever captured, we have a secret code word we will use if ever we get to speak again. A lot of times captives are forced to speak under duress (e.g., gun to head, knife to throat), hence, if for some reason I can’t detect the worry in her voice, she’ll use one of several secret words to signal her true situation. We also have a secret post to leave a message on Financial Samurai. Financial Samurai stayed up every day during the pandemic. It sure as heck will stay up during an invasion. However, in the event that all electronic communication is lost, we will leave little clues in the real world. Related: Five Financial Observations Since The Start Of Russia’s Invasion Of Ukraine  Where To Invest During World War III  The chance of World War III is pretty low, but it’s a good idea to prepare anyway. In the more likely event that our global politicians just play chicken with our lives, here are the financial moves I’ll be more eager to make.  1) Worst case scenario: hoard real assets  Money means nothing during a world war because governments will proceed to crank up the printing press to fund their army, thereby causing inflation. Sometimes there’s hyperinflation, as in the case with Germany post World War One. After World War One, the German Mark fell from 4.2 marks to 8.91 marks per dollar. But paying for war reparations caused an economic collapse. The exchange rate rose to 4,200,000,000,000 marks per dollar by the end of 1923. The rate of inflation was 3,250,000% per month! By mid-1923 workers were being paid as often as three times a day. As soon as the workers got paid, they’d rush to buy some goods before their cash became worthless.  Real assets to consider hoarding include real estate, gold, silver, copper, oil, steel, cars, weapons, watches, matches, lighters, multiple pair of glasses, binoculars, pads, canned food, socks and shoes. Cryptocurrencies plummeted in value while gold surged the day Russia invade Ukraine. Since cash becomes useless, it’s important to have real things to barter with. Unfortunately, the minimalist who rents and owns nothing will be screwed in a high inflation environment. Therefore, you need to be a maximalist who owns everything you want and need that money could once buy.  Kids piling up bricks of cash in Germany due to hyper-inflation  Related: The Inflation Interest Rate Paradox: Why You Must Continuously Invest  2) Bad scenario: buy the most sovereign bonds possible  Buy bonds from the country you think will come out a winner. At least buy bonds in a country that you believe will pay back its debt. The most sovereign country is usually the United States because we have the biggest army, the deepest financial system, and a world currency. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the U.S. dollar gained against the world because the world found relative sanctuary in U.S. assets. This was even though many Americans were freaking out about whether they’d have a job the next week! When Russia invaded Ukraine, the USD strengthened and the Ruble weakened. Remember, everything is relative when it comes to investing. If the Chrysler building in Manhattan blows up tomorrow, stocks will tank and Treasury bonds will surge as investors flee riskier assets. Emerging market equities will probably sell off harder than the S&amp;P 500 as well. Don’t forget the fear of contagion that wrecked the Asian economies in 1997.  I was loading up on municipal bonds after the 10-year bond yield hit 3% in 2018. Then the 10-year bond yield fell to about 0.5% in 2020 and is now back up to 2%. Bonds are once again getting more attractive. In a World War 3 scenario, the U.S. should emerge victorious. Therefore, the world will be buying U.S. Treasuries and U.S. real estate all day long.   3) A swift uncertain scenario: hoard cash and do nothing  If we’re just going through temporary uncertainty, then hoarding cash is just fine. Even though cash is losing purchasing power due to elevated inflation, it’s still better than losing actual money in the stock market. Most politicians are rational, therefore, they usually won’t go crazy with their aggression out of fear they’ll be overthrown. Hoarding cash is the easiest and most logical move to make during times of uncertainty. Here are other capital preservation investments to consider. Paying down debt without fully paying off debt is the wrong move because you’ll still have monthly payments. Liquidity is most valuable during times of uncertainty. The more liquid you are the more choices you have.  4) A positive long-term scenario: buy stocks and real estate  Based on history, buying the S&amp;P 500 at the start of a war has usually proven to be profitable. Below is a chart from Fundstrat that shows how the S&amp;P 500 performed after the Vietnam War, Gulf Wr, Afghanistan War, Iraq War, and Crimean Crisis. The Afghanistan War period is something to be aware of since our current situation is similar. We’ve had a long bull market full of irrational exuberance. The “good thing” is, many of the most expensive growth stocks and speculative assets have already corrected by 50% – 80% within the past six months. Whereas, it took 2-3 years for similar types of securities to correct post the Dotcom bubble.  As for real estate, it is the favored asset class during wartime. When stocks are selling off during a war, real estate tends to hold its value as investors seek the safety of hard assets. Once the war is over, real estate tends to recovery with the economy, often benefitting from heavy government infrastructure spending. If your property isn’t confiscated by the invading country, real estate is as close to a “head I win, tails you lose” scenario. I’m a buyer of private real estate funds.  It’s Always Worth Preparing For The Worst  If there is a World War III, your number one goal is to survive until the chaos clears. Most wars don’t last longer than two years. Think about World War III as round two of another global pandemic. We’ve already experienced two years of the pandemic. Hence, perhaps World War III won’t feel as long or as difficult if it happens. It is incredibly sad an unnecessary war has begun. Lives will be lost. Livelihoods will be ruined. And so much economic progress and goodwill will disappear. Nobody wins if World War III breaks out. We just have to gut it out until better days arrive.

711	1	The U.S. Department of Labor will release the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January, and this data will visually present the latest changes in the U.S. price level at the beginning of the New Year. Currently, as concerns about high inflation continue to grow, the Federal Reserve has released signals at the January meeting that it will take multiple rate hikes and even start tapering during the year.  Currently, the median survey of economists interviewed by Bloomberg and Reuters both expect the U.S. CPI to grow at a year-over-year rate of 7.3% in January, continuing a 40-year high since February 1982. At the same time, CPI growth in January is expected to reach 0.5% YoY, unchanged from the previous month.  https://preview.redd.it/0yfd16bxlyg81.png?width=1419&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=994a0a2211a0cc65c608b61f7c8bd96449780d3e  Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI is expected to rise 5.9% year-on-year in January, up from 5.5%, and 0.5% sequentially, down from 0.6%.  From the above market expectations, it is expected that tonight's CPI growth will probably break 7 for the second consecutive month - as shown in the chart below, the highest forecast in the Bloomberg survey is 7.6%, and the lowest forecast is 7.0%. In the past half year, the upper and lower range of this forecast has only once failed to "count" (last October's data was higher than the highest forecast).  https://preview.redd.it/ke98ny60myg81.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c281e999d00c5e305599d35a5ac895f2ddf4939f  Thus, as long as there are no major mistakes in this month's survey, tonight's CPI data release - "U.S. inflation is high for the second consecutive month in the 7 era", "U.S. CPI in January hit another 40-year high", will probably become the cut-off point for the global financial media coverage ......  Interestingly, however, the White House does not seem to want the focus to remain on the climb in year-over-year data ......  White House spokesman personally "teaches you how to interpret CPI"  On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jen Psaki was asked for her thoughts on the U.S. government's upcoming January CPI data on Thursday during her regular daily press briefing. A reporter asked, "Economists are forecasting a reading that the CPI will rise 7.3 percent year-over-year in January. I want to ask: Do you see any signs in the current data that would suggest that inflation will decline rapidly this year? How confident are you that inflation will fall without hurting demand in the economy?"  To which Psaki responded, "Well, we don't know the exact data yet; I know there will be forecasts. But first, when we look at tomorrow's data, we're looking at recent inflation trends. In both November and December of last year, price increases showed a slowdown relative to the previous month. In January, the year-over-year rate of increase is expected to be almost half of what it was in October of last year."  "This is a sign of progress that the rate of inflation (chain) growth is falling back - especially as it has done in recent months. We will also refer to payroll growth and see how it compares to January's inflation data." Psaki said.  In response to reporters' mention of the 7.3 percent year-over-year CPI growth estimate for January, Psaki said with a slight understatement, "Given what we know about price performance over the past year, we do have a sense that tomorrow's data will show a higher year-over-year rate of growth, and that's because the year-over-year data largely reflects last year's price increases, as we've discussed and have known for a long time of, but it's not reflecting about recent trends."  Psaki emphasized that CPI is divided into month-over-month and year-over-year data. Given what we've seen over the past year, one should focus on the monthly data. "Even if, as some are predicting, the year-over-year figure reaches 7% or more, it would not be surprising, even though we don't yet know exactly how the data will perform."  In fact, from a deeper reading of the economic data, Psaki's "sermon" on Wednesday was actually not without merit.  Some industry insiders pointed out that, although the U.S. CPI data in January year-on-year growth again "broken 7", in the visual impact may indeed seem more eye-catching, but in recent months the U.S. CPI growth rate has indeed fallen for many months: in October rose 0.9%, in November rose 0.8%, in December rose 0.5% in December. If the January CPI growth rate is lower than the current market expectation of 0.5%, it will be the third consecutive month of growth rate decline.  https://preview.redd.it/dveqsk21myg81.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=976745c79b15d99a12ab7d992ed0a86d4cf71c3a  Adam Button, an analyst at the financial website Forexlive, also wrote that Thursday's U.S. CPI report is one of the highlights of this week's U.S. economic calendar. The White House has already taken the precaution of saying that the year-over-year figure will be "high". But Button said, "It would be a mistake to think the White House is suggesting it will be above consensus."  Button noted, "As our friends at Newsweek pointed out: last year, Biden also warned of high inflation ahead of the CPI report, but the report was actually below consensus." Button believes that the market will pay more attention to the monthly rate data and that the composition of the report will be key.  Rare early market speculation on less-than-expected data?  It is worth mentioning that just before the release of the U.S. CPI in January, the trading sentiment of market participants in the financial markets, it seems that there was also a subtle change on Wednesday: the U.S. indicator 10-year U.S. bond yields were once off more than 2 years highs in the session fell sharply, while the Nasdaq rose sharply by more than 2% throughout the day, many insiders attributed these changes in the market to some institutions speculation that tonight's CPI data may be less than market expectations.  At present, although the media survey on Thursday's CPI data overall forecast high, but some analysts said that some areas of price growth will slow down, especially in core commodities such as clothing and used cars.  Michael Gapen, chief U.S. analyst at Barclays (Barclays), then noted that "apparel, new and used cars and alcoholic beverages - these are all components of core CPI, and the pace of price increases in these areas should be lower than in December and lower than the the recent peak in October."  While prices for used cars continued to rise in January, momentum is stalling (and actually even reversing), according to the latest data from industry body Manheim. The Manheim Used Car Value Index climbed only slightly last month to 236.3, and while it still jumped 45 percent year-over-year, the year-over-year increase was only 0.04 percent. In addition the unadjusted price change fell by about 1 percentage point compared to December.  https://preview.redd.it/8twdjwt1myg81.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6522bf8448cf6ad85fe4e56667d6290617ba0d4a  National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan also noted that the U.S. inflation data may show some improvement. Hogan expects the U.S. CPI to rise 0.4 percent in January, below the prior and market consensus expectations, although the year-over-year figure will likely remain at 7.2 percent. Hogan also noted that inflation moving in the right direction would be illuminating, which could Will remove some of the Fed's hawkish tone.  In addition, Jefferies (Jefferies) economist Tom Simons is expected to core CPI growth in January will be recorded at 0.3%, lower than the market's general expectations. He noted that "when the data is slightly lower than expected, people will especially want to know how the Federal Reserve will view the situation. At the end of the day, I don't think this number will be so important as to change anyone's opinion, but I think the subconscious reaction of people will be this."  The whole market is holding its breath  For financial markets, as high inflation has previously been seen as a direct trigger for people to bet heavily on the Fed to raise interest rates aggressively, so tonight's CPI data performance will undoubtedly also become a key factor directly affecting the movement of various assets such as U.S. stocks, U.S. bonds, the dollar and gold.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted last month that the Fed would not rule out the possibility of a 50 basis point direct rate hike in the future, and traders have become more convinced that the Fed will make aggressive moves after the surprisingly strong January nonfarm payrolls report released last Friday and showed significant payroll growth. Federal funds rate futures show that the market now expects the Fed to raise rates in March by 50 basis points of the chances of one-third, higher than the one-fifth before the release of the non-farm payrolls data, the Fed raised rates six times during the year (25 basis points each) probability is also close to fifty percent.  &amp;#x200B;  In this regard, Alvise Marino, head of foreign exchange strategy at Credit Suisse, said that the market may react more strongly if Thursday's CPI data is unexpectedly weaker than expected than inflation again: a data pointing in the opposite direction would represent a big change.  Morgan Stanley strategist Matthew Hornbach said in a research note, if the U.S. January CPI data can make the market feel "surprise" (lower than expected), it will become the only opportunity to save the U.S. Treasury bonds in the short term. But he also pointed out that if the January inflation data continue to deteriorate, then the subsequent series of conditions may lead to a continued decline in U.S. bond prices.
645	1	There are tons of fucking bear catalysts against the whole economy.  \&gt; I brought out the crayons 🖍️ for this one: [https://imgur.com/a/SdghMvb](https://imgur.com/a/SdghMvb)  Everything from the impending war with Ukraine ( food shortages + energy shortages , all the way to the east with China’s real-estate bubble ( housing shortages ). There are major shortages of tons of products with inflation rapidly increasing ( a 40 year high in the united states ( fuck J.P. ) ). Asset/Product prices have been non-stop rising for two years (the price of everything has doubled) which were bought on extremely *low-interest* ( everything will get fucking margin called ). The 10YR 2YR has been cascading hard non stop since March of 2021. The PPI and CPI have almost exponentially grown since the pandemic. The price growth of everything is unsustainable for the long term. It all must level out, and it soon will.     Doom is coming, we have months to prepare. As we all know, once something affects one part of the market, it affects the other causing a domino affect. But what kind of doom? A doom longer than that of 08’ with something closer to the great depression due to such levels of inflation. **So, are we living on a sinking ship?**  In other words  🏦⛏️🔫💎⛏️🔫      🏳️‍🌈🐻=🦍💲💲💲  TLDR: Prediction ( opinion, not financial advice ) -- A return to value will happen about 8.5 months to 12 months = boom boom economy D-Day death time. We have months, and tons of prep. Although knowing you guys, you cant look past the end of the week. Ill see you guys in ≈10 months with update of gay bear DD or humiliating loss porn.        P.S. Can someone give me relationship advice?     Also give credit pls.

But here we are, no one likes fake burgers. Analysts have low expectations and its not getting mentioned on here at all anymore. Its oversold at almost any timeframe and its going down for weeks.     The setup is simple: If they beat, they will rise 20% or so within a few days. This is where you sell 50%. It has some meme value and more importantly: its a company we kind of need in our current world. They have some nice partnerships going on and will easily get more: Its green so brands want to connect their name to it, hence why there are things like a McPlant now. Food will become a hot topic this year due to many failed harvests. So its a nice play for the next months too. Sell your other 50% in a few steps. If we have some good momentum this week, it can run up 20% in a day on good results.   If they dont beat but dont miss bigly: Shorts will probably close soon. Enough profit is made and there is risk keeping shorts open due to being technically oversold.  If they miss: Its expected by now with BYND, and very much priced in. Only real risk if sentiment is bad due to WW3 the day of earnings.   What is the bearcase? They cant make money and people have a instinctive problem with fake meat. Compare it with Tesla many years ago when no one took EV's serious, some people are against it by default. That is also what you see when you look at reviews, most are very biased one side or the other. In time, this will get less and less.   So buy calls 20% out of the money, at least 6 months out, so I can be wrong here (I am not) and you wont lose all your money.  Adios Amigos   tl;dr: Fake meat is low, buy now and sell high.   Disclaimer: I never consumed a product of BYND, and not planning to.

21	1	It appears it may be time for cannabis investors to rejoice. The cannabis sector has been under performing the market for quite some time, but that may soon be changing. A bill to federally legalize marijuana may be coming up for a House floor vote next week, a congressional staffer and a key advocate familiar with the discussions stated on Wednesday March 23rd.  Rumors of a floor vote—which would be the second time that the MORE Act reached the full chamber after being approved in 2020—are now circulating weeks after congressional Democrats held a closed-to-press session at a party retreat that included a panel that largely centered on the reform legislation.  Meanwhile, advocates and stakeholders are eagerly awaiting the formal introduction of a separate Senate legalization bill that’s being finalized by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) etc. Schumer recently said the plan is to file that bill—the Cannabis Administration &amp; Opportunity Act (CAOA)—in April.  [https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-marijuana-legalization-bill-may-receive-house-floor-vote-next-week-sources-say/](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/federal-marijuana-legalization-bill-may-receive-house-floor-vote-next-week-sources-say/)  In separate legislation U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace (R-SC) and Barbara Lee (D-CA) introduced legislation last Friday that would instruct the United Nations (U.N.) to deschedule cannabis from Schedule 1 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and treat cannabis like any other agricultural commodity.  [https://financialregnews.com/reps-mace-lee-introduce-resolution-instructing-u-n-to-deschedule-cannabis/](https://financialregnews.com/reps-mace-lee-introduce-resolution-instructing-u-n-to-deschedule-cannabis/)  The global cannabis market is expected to see brisk growth in 2022, driven by strong sales in new and emerging markets in the U.S., steady growth in Canada, and international markets led by Mexico and Germany. Sales of legal cannabis products, including cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals outside the U.S. and Canada were estimated by BDSA at $1.4 billion in spending for 2021 and are forecast to grow to $2.2 billion in 2022. International sales are expected to reach $9.5 billion by 2026, a CAGR of approximately 46% from 2021.  [https://www.greenentrepreneur.com/article/422087](https://www.greenentrepreneur.com/article/422087)  I certainly have felt the pain as an investor in the cannabis sector (most heavily in TLRY) this past year, but I am looking forward to the near future as it seems good things are to come as lobbyists, businesses, civil rights groups and human rights groups continue to lobby Congress to act immediately on cannabis reform.

442	1	Buy TQQQ, don't buy defense stock. My reasoning  1.Do people actually believe that the US would intervene against Ukraine?  The last thing Biden wants is to sent troops and intervene in this situation. Currently speaking Biden has an approval rate of 42%. Do you really think people who voted for him would want to send soldiers to Ukraine, I doubt so. His approval rate is already horrible with covid and the economy, it is the worst thing for him to do and sent soldiers.  What does this mean? These stocks are not worth buying and highly doubt the US would have actually intervention but rather just have sanctions.  2. the US was to join, wouldn't it be too late as this was anticipated for a while now?  If anything, why not buy commodities? I just don't think it's worth the risk, there are so many better stocks you could pick. Wheat futures, oil but it's pretty high.  3. Why do some people think this situation with Russia Ukraine would start WWIII with nukes?  Countries do not want to use their nukes, it is just to show their global power. It is the last interest for countries to actually use it. Hold your stocks, don't panic, and sell.  What if WWIII really does start? The real answer is to wait for waffle house to go public.  4. With this situation going on, bear market with inflation/rate hikes, buy TQQQ!  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/wmjb9t0a2xj81.png?width=905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=648e437652ed9734faff9e983bc10f751f38601c

Mercer International was the only pulp producer not effected by supply chain issues when all of Canada’s roads and railways got washed out last November. The Canadian competition (West Fraser and Canfor) ate shit because they couldn’t ship their product. Finland competition (UPM) was busy being on strike. South American pulp production was delayed.

192	1	 The U.S. [Senate](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate)  passed a $1.5 trillion, 2,741-page omnibus spending bill on Thursday  evening that will fund the federal government through Sept. 30 and send  $13.6 billion in aid to [Ukraine](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine).   The bill passed 68-31 and now goes to President Biden's desk.   Nearly $14 billion in U.S. aid will go to Ukraine and [European](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe) allies in the fight against [Russia](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia), including funds to provide humanitarian aid to the millions of Ukrainians who have fled, as well as funds for weapons.  Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy) appealed to lawmakers in a Zoom call on Saturday for more help in his country's fight against Russia.   The $1.5 trillion spending bill includes a 6.7% bump in domestic  programs to $730 billion and a 5.6% increase in defense spending to $782  billion.   "The bipartisan product contains major wins for our  national defense, for our friends in Ukraine, for the conscience rights  of the American people, and for many other key priorities, and it keeps  new left-wing poison pills out," U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch  McConnell, Ky., said ahead of the vote.   Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also praised the bill as bipartisan.   "When  we're unable to find common ground, Democrats will hold firm in defense  of our values and be willing to work alone, if needed. But this week,  bipartisanship has propelled us over the finish line," Schumer said on  the Senate floor Thursday evening.   President Biden had originally  proposed a 16% increase in domestic spending and just 2% for defense  last spring, but that became unrealistic due to the Democrats' slim  majority and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   Missing from the bill is $15.6 billion to combat the COVID-19  pandemic. House Democrats refused to accept Republican demands that new  funding is paid for with cuts in previously passed pandemic aid.   "We’ve  got a war going on in Ukraine," Pelosi told reporters Wednesday when  explaining the compromise. "We have important work that we’re doing  here."  House Democrats plan to hold a vote next week on the $15.6 billion in COVID-19 funds.   Congress was facing a deadline of Friday at midnight to pass the bill or a government shutdown would ensue.   [Source](https://www.foxnews.com/us/senate-sends-massive-1-5-trillion-spending-bill-to-bidens-desk)  &amp;#x200B;  With all the talk about inflation and interest rates hikes next week.

431	1	OG Wsber's might remember the good ol' steel beam play $CLF, which made some rich fuckers on its bull run last year. I'm here today to remind and tell some og's and newbs about the play. CLF (Cleveland-Cliffs) is a U.S. steel producer currently with a **$11 bil market cap at a 3.6 P/E**. Yea that's right, 11 bil, this isnt a shit pennystock. Clf competes with Nucor (NUE) sitting at a whopping **$37 bil at a P/E of 5.2,** admittedly it's a stronger company, and deserves its spot at the top.  So, why not nue then? It literally just hit a new all time high today, and is arguably overextended, with volume dropping off a cliff from late 2021.  While clf isn't at the level of nue yet, it's barely known, has strong fundamentals, and has room to grow, currently at a close of $21.21 at 10% on the day, it's about 25% off its 52 week high of 26.51. While the last quarters earnings were a miss at 1.76 vs ~2.05 expected, fundamentals are still strong. **2021 revenue was $20.4 bil at a net income of $3 bil. Strong long term, arguably undervalued as fuck and here's why:**  On the last earnings call, the CEO Lourenco Goncalves announced a **$1 billion** share buyback program. About 10% of the float is available to be bought for the year.   Quote from the chad CEO in reference to how the buyback will go: "Our company should be returning money to the shareholders. Buying back stock is a tax‐efficient way to reward long‐term shareholders instead of allowing them to be at the mercy of the opportunistic, of the mercy of the ones that don’t understand. So let's see how stupid the market is, that will dictate how aggressive i will be".   **TLDR: The Ceo is going long, and betting (up to) $1 billion on his play. I'm going along for the ride, and hoping to make some fucking money.** My position is pretty poverty and i fucked up on the timing (tried to play earnings, but the miss kinda fucked me) so theta is going to hurt, but anyways **my (not financial) advice would be long on shares for the pusses, May 20 calls for longer exposure, or March 18 calls if you want to yolo with me.**  [Position: 3/18 21 Call](https://imgur.com/a/cz8mjbj)
351	1	I noticed that the hedge fund VIX goes up crazy whenever the market drops.  I suspect they use short ladder attacks to drop the market like citadel but I can't find out who they are or what type of financial services they provide.  I started looking for who owns VIX because my 495 weekly SPY calls went to shit after I bought them in January after it ramped.  Well, of course, SPY tanked and I lost everything.  I even tried more complicated options positions on robinhood like a vertical spread.  I bought the February 470 SPY call then bought the 475 SPY call with the same expiration.  If you don't already know, the point of a vertical spread is to buy cheaper options above the calls you think are going to be in the money at expiration.  That way if you are right you make even more money.  You do this instead of just buying the same strike so you risk less.    I honestly don't know how the SEC hasn't gone after VIX yet.  They make a profit EVERY TIME the market goes down.  The only thing that explains it is if they are manipulating the market.  I read on Bloomberg that there are a ton of VIX algos so I'm not surprised at all.  Honestly I'm so fed up with losing my money unfairly that  I might start a petition to investigate VIX and all the other hedge funds that short ladder attack when I have calls.  Who else is on board?

891	1	$SPDR® S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust going into today after yesterdays green day and after google/ amd popped off after hours... my question that i expect to get an answer to today is whether $Invesco QQQ Trust is forshadowing where SPY is going.  let me explain...  so with the January dip we saw two highs on 1/4 and then 1/13. as we know Tech was the heaviest hit by that dip with QQQ being way over weight tech they obviously saw a much bigger correction around almost 20% from the high while spy only saw 10%...   now lets look at last week and this week. whats driving the market? tech of course. so today we saw spy break and close above 365 which if you see on their daily chart means they broke their resistance line from 1/4 and 1/13 (white dotted).  my forshadowing thought process is that SPYs equivalent resistance line from 1/4 and 1/13 is around 460. many if not everyone is citing how 460 is going to be a major barrier for SPY to break. but what if it actually isnt going to be?  think about it... QQQ closed above and broke their resistance line. techs (google) gonna push this bullish tomorrow.  SPY closed at 452.95 and bumped to 455 after hours... if SPY saw a 2% day tomorrow it puts it near 462... 2% bull day when google is up 10% after hours is not unrealistic at all.  QQQ next resistance is 376 (daily 50/ 100 EMA). That would only take a 3% tomorrow to touch resistance there... which is not unrealistic.  so the question is... right now is QQQ leading SPY and foreshadowing further upside for at least this week?  in my opinion yes. im watching for QQQ to break its 376 resistance. if we see a rejection SPY may see a rejection of 460 but i suspect this bullrun continues through end of week assuming meta and amazon continues the tech earning beats...  https://i.imgur.com/eW1BpmR.jpeg https://i.imgur.com/fEPjHJM.jpeg

I don’t care if I lose the $500 I’ll make that back in 2 weeks at my minimum wage job, the problem is my profits will only be $1500 and that’s not enough to post on wsb I need more money but, I don’t have a marginal account and no one trusts me to pay them back. Fuck. Go to deposit my $500 when I make a tiny mistake and add an extra 0, making it $5,000. Deposit goes through. Freak out and check bank account, still at $500. Remember that it will take 2-3 days for the money to clear. Remember it can’t go tits up. Buy $5,000 in options set at 10% stop loss, it doesnt hit. Up 300% and sell before end of day, account worth $20,000. Cancel 5,000 deposit. Account now worth $15,000. Realize I literally made $15,000 from a $0  investment because money was never taken from my account. Infinite returns.    (This is loosely based on a true story)

It’s more so price gouging the price of fertilizer is up 200% compared to last year, and as far as chemistry it’s very difficult to almost impossible to find chemicals like roundup and atrizine and if you do find them you’ll be paying in upwards to 45$ per gallon versus the 12 bucks a gallon we bought it for last year thankfully we put our orders in right after harvest last year and got all the chemicals we need for this year. But it’s going to become a very interesting world in the next 5 years, if the cost to grow the corn/soybeans went up 200-300% then you could only imagine what the cost of the finished product on the store Shelves will be,

861	1	 Hello everyone, this is due diligence on a stock that just merged. They are the owner of various web properties including map quest, startpage, how stuff works, and dozens of others. They also own an antivirus software and an ad-blocker generating subscription revenue.  At the end of June, Cannae and System1 made a deal to make a business combination. The [merge](https://ir.system1.com/news/news-details/2021/System1-a-Leading-Omnichannel-Customer-Acquisition-Platform-to-Become-a-Publicly-Listed-Company-Through-a-Business-Combination-With-Trebia-Acquisition-Corp/default.aspx).  At the time, I was pretty enchanted by the fact that management was rolling over 100% of its equity, and that the company would essentially be fully backstopped which is a sign that Bill Foley (Legendary businessman and investor) truly believed in the company. It was also going to be one of the few SPAC mergers where the company was actually profitable.  As it's been under the radar, there has been informational arbitrage. First, the company released first half results, where they not only **beat** guidance but **raised it.** You can find the release [here](https://ir.system1.com/news/news-details/2021/System1-Increases-Fiscal-Year-2021-Guidance-/default.aspx).  To give a summation on guidance, they increased adjusted revenue guidance by **5 percent for the full year**. They also increased adjusted EBITDA **for the full year 11.22%**.  Finally, they reported Net income of **24M.** The stock did not move, as it went unnoticed.  Then, they reported 3rd quarter results where they beat and raised again. You can find the release [here](https://ir.system1.com/news/news-details/2021/System1-Reports-Preliminary-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx).   To give a summation on guidance, they **increased revenue guidance for the full year 3.5%**. They **increased adjusted EBITDA for the full year by 1.8%**. Their **net income YTD is 45M**, and 21M in the third quarter alone which represents an almost 100% increase in net income increase. They also released an analyst presentation.  For some highlights:  * Revenue was up 47% * Gross profit was up 72% * The company will maintain the rule of 40 which means top line or bottom-line growth YoY combined exceeds 40%, and will do so for the foreseeable future. * Advertising revenue through Owned and operated properties as well as affiliates, and AV subscription revenue * International Expansion which has been relatively untapped, and inorganic acquisitions which they can monetize through their RAMP platform * Isn't affected by Google or Apple privacy moves  **Valuation:**  This is the latest investor [presentation](https://s27.q4cdn.com/320020032/files/doc_presentation/2021/09/System1-Investor-Presentation_vF.pdf).  The outstanding share count, including sponsor shares and earnout shares but excluding warrants, is 132.4M shares outstanding (Slide 39). You can find warrant count in SEC filings, but I don't want to write a long write up today as I need to go do things today.  YTD net income is at 45M, which means YTD EPS is at .3436, which means that over 3 quarters the company has a Price to earnings multiple of 28.98. I'm going to be blunt and say that Q4 will be a beat, and that **net income will come in at around 23-26M.** This would mean, on the low end, 68M in net income. **This translates to projected full year EPS of .5135 cents, and a price to earnings ratio of 19.396 on the low end of guidance.**  Now, one of the uses for the cash once the merger happens, will be to pay down 176M worth of existing debt. If you scroll down to the Q3 Earnings release you can see the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation, and specifically interest expense which sits at 12.4M. Existing debt is currently at 317M (Slide 7), and they intend to reduce that by 176 or 55.52%. **This would mean an interest expense decrease of roughly 6.88M.** While i expect cash to be deployed for inorganic acquisitions, that's fine.   Furthermore, restructuring and other charges include onetime charges which won't be seen again. Though I expect once the merger goes through, they'll report the onetime expense of 55M.   Look at page 30-33 of the analyst presentation they released Nov 5 which can be found [here.](https://s27.q4cdn.com/320020032/files/doc_presentation/2021/11/System1-Analyst-Day-Presentation_vFinal.pdf) They address TAM and potential growth trajectories.   Finally, their FCF (Adjusted EBITDA which is operating profit excluding share-based compensation, D&amp;A, and non-recurring expenses) is very strong as they are in the advertising and subscription-based space. It sits at 90M with YoY growth of 123% and margin at 15.2%. Consider the fact that this is still a company that is growing at break neck speed, and you have a winner winner, chicken dinner here. This is a Peter Lynch GARP approved growth stock.

Then the next big thing will be **"mRNA Performance Enhancing Drugs!"**  Stick with me on this one. So currently there are all these test for steroids. In fact a lot of athletes use steroids during the off season to train and then stop before it is time to test. BUT! **mRNA is completely untraceable.** ***"The new frontier of performance enhancing drugs!"*** Athletes could juice all the way up to the competitions. Think about all the records they could break!  It's the perfect market! Athletes have been resistant to vaccination because they don't know what it may do to their bodies.

163	1	Seems like Visa and Master Card may fall a bit Monday opening.  https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-banks-are-rushing-switch-over-chinese-card-system-2022-3?utm_source=reddit.com  Russian banks are planning a switch to China's card payment system after Mastercard and Visa halted operations.  Russian banks could switch to using China's card payment system, UnionPay, after MasterCard and Visa suspended operations in Russia, according to media reports.   Russia's largest bank Sberbank announced it was looking at issuing cards using the UnionPay system in conjunction with Russia's domestic Mir payments system, Bloomberg reported. Alfa Bank is already pushing ahead with plans to issue cards using UnionPay, while the newswire cited Tinkoff Bank as saying that it would issue cards with UnionPay as soon as possible.  The three banks did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.  Visa, Mastercard, and American Express announced on March 5 and 6 that they would suspend operations in Russia as a result of Moscow's decision to invade Ukraine. All three previously said that they had blocked certain Russian banks in an effort to comply with Western sanctions against the country.

850	1	I've seen a lot of speculation on whether it's worth buying the dip on FB.  Maybe it will bounce this week or next, but nobody, under any circumstances, should be long on FB.  I work in tech, and my best estimation is that the Metaverse announcement was literally *because* FB could see the writing on the wall internally, and knew they were going to miss on earnings, so they had to create *some* narrative which would justify holding FB.  Social networks have a couple important properties:  1. They're generational - people tend to use the network which their age cohort is using.  The younger generation flocks to a new network during high-school age to avoid their parents, and then gradually the older generation starts to pile in.  2. They rely on network affects.  There's always going to be at most a couple "winners" and everyone will move to those because a social network is worthless once people feel like that's not where the activity is.  FB managed to stave off disaster and hold on to millennials buy buying Instagram, while keeping facebook.com as a high-profit environment where they could just bombard vulnerable old people and conspiracy theorists with high margin advertising (kind of like cable news).  But they have failed to capture the younger generation who've moved to TikTok.  And since there is only room for one mainstream social network for every generation, that leaves them with no real avenue for growth.  So the metaverse is a totally impractical hail-marry.  Basically what FB wants to convince you of is that they will be able to construct a compelling virtual reality and productize it faster than TikTok can eat their lunch.  This is an extreme challenge for a number of reasons.  The main one being: what they're describing is *incredibly* capital intensive.  The amount of compute required to create a persistent interactive virtual reality for the entire world to play in is *orders of magnitude* higher than what's required to host images, videos and comments as they do now.  Who's going to pay for that?  Are advertisers going to pay 100x higher ad-rates to put up a billboard in a totally un-tested platform when they can just buy ads on TikTok instead?  Maybe we'll get a metaverse someday, but at best it's decades away, and it's going to happen bottom-up from the expansion of MMO's and platforms like Roblox.  It's not going to happen because a failing social network, with zero competency in the space, needs it to prop up their share price.

Everyday humans who decided to rally against something significant and broken, put their money, not someone else’s - into a cause and the brokerages that make their money through retail support just took the piss.   If you ever wondered how these brokers will deal if and when the inevitable happens with some of these stocks, best believe this is what they think of you and what you deserve.   E-trade deserves nothing from you if you’re invested in anything that’s been marred as a meme.   Responding with your feet is the way

255	0	As the title suggests, how is everyone feeling right now? Like truly, how is everyone feeling during these times because as much as we want to try to add humor to our mega capital losses through memes and trying to brush it off, I know some of you are still looking in the mirror asking how could you lose all that money you worked soo hard for. Money you probably needed or money your family could use. Maybe it was tuition money or money for a rainy day. Regardless, losing is part of trading but it sure beats you down and makes you lose confidence in ever trading again. It may even traumatize you enough to the point you may never trade the same way and that’s okay.   I personally have been there when i first started investing solo, no advisors and strictly going with my gut picks on individual stocks instead of just investing more into my 401k or into ETFs to reduce risk and take tax advantage. What happened literally a few days after i poured a bunch of money into the market  on my individual picks i researched a ton on? The pandemic hit LOL, how lucky right? Never seen 50% of my investment disappear like that before with no idea what to do because I was a novice of trading solo. I had shares and looking back I could’ve averaged down and kept holding. Instead i sold at 50% loss and I tried soo hard to get my losses back. I shorted the market and invested in gold stocks and luckily for me it panned out after months of grinding. But had i even done nothing and held my shares i would not only have made my money back but some of these at ath were at 10x+. Not saying i would’ve diamond held for that long but my point is this:  Identify what you did wrong and mitigate it from ever happening again. If you trust your stock picks just hold and keep avg down on any big drops. Have stop losses and try to learn through paper trading or through tiny investments first before going ballz deep. When you win keep in mind someone else is losing so take your wins and temporarily celebrate but be grateful you were on the winning side and thank the players for their sacrifice. Many people lose a ton of money and never trade again. My advice is to never give up if you truly enjoy the process because i obsessed over trading everyday. I am no pro, but I learned a ton through losing and I’m glad I didn’t give up because I love trading, i love researching, i love business, and I love these communities where we can share each other’s stories and help one another win and beat the big man.   Hats off to all you apes 🦍 who keep on grinding everyday and keep learning and invest in yourself to get better at your craft because practice and experience does make the difference. I am not a millionaire nor am I telling you to do anything, but my passion is telling stories and experiences that can help others going through similar situations and letting them know it will be Okay.   I believe in you my fellow apes 🦍 and keep on keeping on!

14	1	Germany [relies on Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/business/olaf-scholz-russia-energy.html) for 55% of its natural gas and 50% of its coal. Germany's Chancellor refuses to boycott Russian energy, saying it "would mean plunging our country and all of Europe into recession."  Although Germany has lots of renewable energy, as of 2020 it [still relied on non-renewables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Germany#Energy_transition) for 49% of its energy needs.  The Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory opened yesterday, located just outside of Berlin. The factory *plans to* generate power through solar panels, but the factory isn't finished yet. To what extent are the gigafactory's operations and the gigafactory's construction process relying on the German power grid, which relies on Russian imports and finances the invasion of Ukraine?  **Solar Power**  Berlin gets 1727 hours of sunshine per year on average. That's less sunshine than Seattle gets. It's also less sunshine than other Gigafactory locations.   * Buffalo = 2206 hours  * Austin = 2643 hours * San Francisco (near Fremont) = 3061 hours * Reno = 3645 hours  Berlin gets less than half the sunshine that GigaNevada gets, and what's worse is the February and March are particularly bad months for Berlin, averaging only 3-4 hours of sunshine per day.  Furthermore, Tesla's promises and the reality are not the same. For example, GigaNevada had [only 3.2MW of solar panels in August 2021](https://electrek.co/2021/08/09/tesla-slashes-size-gigafactory-solar-array-but-says-grow-largest-world/) out of a planned 70 MW solar array. By the end of 2022, they plan to grow to 24 MW.  The logical assumption would be that GigaBerlin is behind GigaNevada, and that Berlin has less than 3.2MW of installed solar capacity. With 4 hours of sunshine per day and less than 3.2 MW of capacity, you would generate something around 500 kWh of power per day. That's enough power for 10 houses per day. Hardly enough power to produce 1,000 cars a week.  For context, BMW's plant in Regensburg Germany has used [168 MWh](https://phys.org/news/2013-04-automobile.html) in a year, which would be 460,000 kWh per day. So how much solar generating capacity would GigaBerlin need?   168,000 MWh / 365 / 24 = 19.17 MW power generating capacity needed, twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. That's 7 times GigaNevada's installed capacity. Also the sun doesn't shine 24/7, even in Nevada.  For Berlin to generate that much electricity from solar panels in March, they would need to install 120 MW of capacity--40 times what is currently installed in Nevada. (You would also need a massive battery system to discharge power when the sun isn't shining). I have a feeling that if Berlin had installed that many solar panels, Elon would be talking about it all day long. He's not.    Conclusion: **There's no fucking way that Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory is net-zero. They're running off of German electricity, which means Russian gas.**  **The kicker**  Putin wants Germany to pay for energy imports using Rubles. Not only is Germany going to finance the Russian war machine, it's also going to help prop up the Ruble--working directly against the sanctions that the rest of the world is trying to use to stop the war.   Positions: Long-Dated Puts on TSLA. Remember my name.  ---  Epilogue:   I'm anticipating a counterargument from people who don't understand how electricity works:  **German Electric Grid**  Some people might argue that the area of Brandenburg generates a lot of renewable energy. That's true. It's also irrelevant. It doesn't matter where you connect to the grid--you're either a net consumer or a net contributor. If the national electricity demand rises because you're a net consumer, then the coal, gas, and nuclear plants will increase their output by adding more fuel. Solar and wind plants can't do that because they rely on nature, not fuel. Here's the definition of an [opportunity cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp) for the apes who don't understand.  **Heat Pumps**  These cut electricity costs. They don't generate power.

33	0	Ever since the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve has chosen to pump up markets and create an economy that not only expects low interest rates, but neeeds low interest rates. The results have been zombie companies, weak growth, and a government full of debt. The Pandemic didnt change our trajectory, it just sped up the process. Now our fearless leaders realize they are backed in a corner and now have to sacrifice the housing market, equity market, or main street economy... if they try hard, they will manage to harm all three.   The Fed is going to allow the stock market to turn upside down. They dont care about stocks or housing, they cannot allow the credit market to self destruct. If that means your stocks go down 25%, they can live with that. And on top of that, our economy and currency system are being used as weapons of war with no possible way to predict how that will turn out.   So what the hell do we do? I'm investing heavily in commodities. You will see governments and companies start to hoard commodities. Prices of these commodities will only go up. Maybe buy REITs for essential properties where the REIT owner has pricing elasticity. I also think there will be some good short squeeze opportunities as hedge funds will get desperate for returns.

Doesn't this mean that these shorts are out in the open for anyone to squeeze? Don't companies like Citadel pay a premium for information like this that these funds are giving out to everyone for basically free?  Please let me know if I'm missing something here, but it sounds like easy money to me.
