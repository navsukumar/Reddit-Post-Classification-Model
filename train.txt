You dumb retreaded fucks measure these companies in dollars and pay no attention to what the dollars actually mean relative to real things. Whether they be good services, like the service your wife‚Äôs bf gives her, or the service you give at Wendy‚Äôs. You still get the same 20 for the handy, and you get some burger instead of two to bring home to her bf. fo fucks sakes you dumb bullish fucks. Most of your gains are still loss porn. You‚Äôre to dumb to notice!

Also, the Russian invasion could have wrapped up within 3 days, resulting in just a change of the Ukrainian admin and territories, not in fucking casualties, infrastructure damages in the Ukraine, nuclear fear, absurd increase in oil and other commodity price and possible stagflation. Thanks to sleepy fucking joe, so many unnecessary shit has taken place, and now we are talking about fucking stagflation, which wasn‚Äôt even for a debate and in anybody‚Äôs head.   The Ukrainian admin is already corrupt af. Replacing Zelensky and his friends in power with Russian puppets wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference in the everyday life of average Ukrainians anyways, not to mention the average Ukrainians would be still making $300 month whether Zelensky is in power or not.  Fuck Putin, but fuck sleepy the fuckmouth twice.

Anyone catch the CEO's tweets today talking about the fact anybody selling his company's stock might end up leaving a note on their nightstand while their feet thrash in regret above the floor?

This is the fully rational YOLO of the bespectacled, something the Vatican's wealth fund would look into.
609	1	As a follow up on my previous post, where I discussed Melvins portfolio of stocks with negative earnings, ridiculously high multiples and billions of dollars of insider selling, I decided to do more research.  As I mentioned in my last post, a lot of these stocks have been receiving analyst upgrades by big banks and other hedgies (DDOG, SNOW, NOW, BILL, etc‚Ä¶) My previous thought was that Melvin was somehow pumping up these stocks through the options market (they happen to own a significant amount of calls on many of these shitcos). However, after doing some more thinking, this theory seemed a little far fetched and didn‚Äôt have enough backup to prove, although still possible.  So then I started thinking, how is it that these stocks with such shitty financials have held up so well in an environment where other growth stocks and loss-making companies with high debt are getting punished? Hell, blue chips have taken more of a beating than most of these stocks have. As an example, LYV (Live Nation Entertainment) is Melvins largest holding as per their latest 13F. The media seems to be pushing the narrative that Melvin has only been taking big losses, but LYV is up 240% since it‚Äôs Covid lows, and it hasn‚Äôt corrected at all as of yet. Many of his other biggest positions such as H, HLT, EXPE, DDOG, NOW and BILL have also been killing it. Mastercard was also previously one of Melvins largest positions, and it appeared they sold out when it was close to all time highs, making a killing.   Now, why would big media like Bloomberg be pushing the narrative that Melvin has been losing so much money when it seems as though that‚Äôs not the case? For one reason or another, they want apes to believe that, but I can‚Äôt quite figure that part out.   I do have a possible theory that Melvin is in fact collaborating with the big banks and other hedgies to bag hold for them when shit goes down the hole, eventually. Since Melvin might already be fucked for legal reasons and they know it, is it possible that they are essentially being used by other institutions to falsely prop of valuations of shitcos and prevent a market crash? Again, just a theory. However, it seems as though the big banks are currently being investigated for collaborating with hedgies, so this seems very plausible. I believe Melvin could be the main one.  I would appreciate it if other smooth brains out there could look into this as well and perhaps confirm my theories or bring up more likely ones.   TLDR; I think there is a Ponzi scheme going on between Melvin, other institutions like Citadel, and the big banks to falsely prop up markets for their benefit. I think they are all in bed together.

985	1	The way I see it the market is reacting emotionally to fears of inflation, the fed, and world politics. But the labor markets are historically well off, GDP growth is high, covid cases are going down - and really can only improve from here, supply chains are slowly unwinding, and inflation is peaking.   Imagine covid being a long hike up a mountain with chances of slipping from lockdowns, liquidity drying up , bank runs, tangled supply chains etc etc. We've gone up that mountain and now we can finally start hiking back down. We see unemployment at pre-pandemic levels and our society is learning how to transition from a pandemic response to an endemic response. Of course this descent back down the mountain does require us to keep our footing. I personally have faith in J Powell in taking the safe, conservative approach of predictable, incremental, and slow rate hikes/ quantitative tightening to give a chance to see how improving supply chains decelerate inflation. I personally think Russia is mostly posturing and no real conflict will come of this. I personally think covid has accelerated technological advancement in many ways. And as soon as omicron cases start to dissipate near spring, consumers will begin to use their purchasing power on more industries, specifically hospitality/ travel. As EVs and clean energy continue to come online, less reliance on oil will continue, and not just in the US but globally.   I really don't see much downside risk after this recent correction. You could say any slips and falls going down the mountain have been mostly priced in by now. I mean we have room to breathe. I think now is one of the rare times during a correction where you can feel comfortable about "buying the dip". Think about all the other market corrections/ crashes. In '08, when banks were going out of business and houses lost half their price, things were A LOT more uncertain. When unemployment rose at a faster pace than any other time in history and peaked at a figure not seen since the 50s, no one knew how long it would last and many thought this was going to lead to a second Great Depression. Now, markets are almost 10% down on the S&amp;P500 and over 15% down in the NASDAQ. We have to ask ourselves are times really this uncertain? I think many of you may be in for a surprise to see how quickly inflation will taper off and how quickly supply chains will fix themselves. I am personally very bullish about the future in the US and globally.

790	0	Fellow r/tards I really need your help with something and i should have asked a long time ago, but im tired of living in my car. i deserve this win. i purchased puts on the STRY to trim in down but happy to elaborate if asked. I timed my purchase of around 2,000 ish Shares of amc minutes before it exploded for the may run up. once the share price hit 27 my shares disappeared and TD ameritrade locked me out of my account. 6 days i spent talking to 15-20 different Tylers and stevens. I was told they noticed suspicious activity on my account and its gotta go through their (fraud department i think it was) and i should have access within  3-5 business days. Same answer until day 3 i spoke to tyler who took some initiative to dive deeper and told me, " yeah this is quite strange, we definitely made a mistake im very sorry, but the fraud department has to grant you access again... it was i think days 6 they let me back in to find my account liquidated and they left me with the initial cash deposit of 13.1k . and i tranferred out and vowed never to deal with them again. they say your broker wont ever let you beat them and i found that to be unfairly true. i was in disbelief and shock for a long while to say the least. i won. i made a good call and they stole my winnings. I let myself believe the terms and conditions and they can literally do whatever they wish to your account and your money...Then a few months letter i received a statement showing what my account was worth while they locked me out. i deposited 13k ish total and they liquidated my account when a value of  nearly .5 million was reached. i became sick to my stomach...  ive wanted to seek legal help since but have the slightest idea where to even find the right attorney.   Now the record building burned and all i can think about is the evidence to their wrongdoing burning with it.   either way, is there any case to be made on my behalf? can the taped of my calls be retrived and any evidence or can they make it disappear. Its not even about the money to me. I would give it all to they lawyer. Its about being right and standing up for myself. not letting them get away with their usual bullshit. Its about justice. because I 100 percent believe they took nefarious actions towards me because i beat them at their own game that day. Their employee knew they were wrong. they all know it. but they know they can get away with screwing me over too.. Do i have any chance of winning this in court? Thank you. Sorry about the length.

788	1	There's a decent amount of money invested in CRISPR-based genome editing tech, and this [older DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mocpd2/edit_everything_tastes_better_crispr/) covers the general ideas pretty well.    That previous post touches on the IP battle, and I'd writing today to remind you that this shit *still* isn't settled. [This recent article](https://www.science.org/content/article/new-crispr-patent-hearing-continues-high-stakes-legal-battle) discusses the state of things, with **Team Broad/MIT** bickering with **Team CVC** about who did what, when, and which matters more. The USPTO royally fucked up by granting two patents for essentially the same invention: the "single guide RNA" at the heart of CRISPR-based genome editing. This is an issue that *must* be resolved because right now it's in IP limbo - not good. USPTO doesn't typically hire WSBers, but sometimes one of you will slip through the cracks.    When the IP battle is settled, one side will win, and the other will fall. There's also a possibility of a "patent pool" - basically a truce that lets them split rights/profits - but so much money and vitriol has been invested that it doesn't look like any peace is forthcoming. Below I'll make my forecast regarding who's likely to win, but only a fool would pretend they know this with any certainty. Let's first introduce the players:    **Team Broad/MIT**   **$EDIT** Editas - These guys are "ahead" in the patent battle, but they have not been very successful in the clinic. They bet on curing a rare form of blindness, probably getting all jazzed up on the headlines they imagined: *biotech company lets the blind see*. But their first clinical trial had [underwhelming results](https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/trial-results/editas-falls-well-short-brilliance), and their stock tanked once the data were unveiled. Not the best. I'm not super optimistic about anything else these guys are working on. In short (pun absolutely intended), the science isn't strong here so if the IP battle goes south they're utterly fucked.    **$BEAM** Beam Therapeutics - This company is based on a CRISPR variant called "base editing" that has some likely safety advantages and is better at fixing fucked up genes, as opposed to just killing troublemaker genes. [They'll be in the clinic soon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jairhilburn/2021/08/10/beam-therapeutics-is-aiming-to-start-human-trials-for-its-sickle-cell-treatment/?sh=40cb657f4fd7), and are only lagging because it's a younger company / newer technology. As great as this tech is, they rely on the Broad/MIT IP for their fundamental CRISPR tech, so if the IP outcome goes against them, they'll probably take a hit. But they'll probably fare much better than $EDIT.   **Team CVC**   **$NTLA** Intellia - This company [actually cured people](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/28/1010866264/patrick-doherty-inherited-a-devastating-disease-a-breakthrough-stopped-it), and they used nanoparticles (like for mRNA vaccines) to administer the CRISPR enzymes. They started with a rare disease but should be able to pivot towards genetic tweaks of the liver that can lower your risk of heart disease. Basically a one-time genetic surgery that does the job of statins (and then some?).    **$CRSP** CRISPR Therapeutics - This company also [cured dozens of people](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/31/1067400512/first-sickle-cell-patient-treated-with-crispr-gene-editing-still-thriving) of their hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease. Truly life-changing, miraculous stuff. The catch is that so far they had to do it via a complicated and expensive transplantation procedure. So it's not very clear how profitable they'll be in the long term. They have other stuff in their portfolio as well, though, so they're not exactly up shit creek.    **Who would I bet on?** I would *definitely* bet on Team CVC, and short Team Broad/MIT - specifically $EDIT. The [juicy semi-recent news](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cvc-files-motion-in-opposition-to-broad-7034091/) is that a scientist on Team Broad/MIT got subpoenaed and actually testified that Broad/MIT lifted a core technology from CVC (even though their patent filing said otherwise). This whistleblower scientist was already the source of some older drama - Broad/MIT tried to retroactively remove him as an inventor (presumably because he wouldn't take part in the cover-up) which caused Broad/MIT to have their patent [tossed in the trash](https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_147316) when it was considered by the European patent office. I think the truth will eventually come out, and Team Broad/MIT is going to take a cataclysmic hit once the IP is eventually handed to Team CVC.    **The big catch?** Nobody has any fucking clue when the hammer will fall. From the article I linked above: "PTAB did not make any decision at the end of the proceeding, nor did the judges indicate when they would issue an opinion." Even when the big decision arrives, it will inevitably be appealed, which dampens the finality (and impact) of any one decision from the USPTO. But still - this whole situation is teeming with potential for the sort of breakneck swings in value you perverts live for, so consider yourself notified. Good luck, and sincere apologies to anyone who makes any decisions based on anything I've said here.
980	0	**Quick Note:** I‚Äôm going to be very straight-forward and use a format that is close to industry standard and leaves out all the fluff that others include in their DD because I know you won‚Äôt read it otherwise. Since I know many of you retards can't handle this level of analysis, I've included numerous links for reference in an attempt to create one goddamn wrinkle in your silky smooth brain.  # TL;DR - PT of $104 w/expected Div of $20+ for 100% 1-Yr Gains  # THE STRATEGY  **YIELD PLAY WITH SOLID POTENTIAL UPSIDE IN STOCK PRICE**  Hold the shares, collect 30-50% annualized dividend, collect massive premiums from covered calls, and leave some shares uncovered in case price soars. If you‚Äôre poor or lost most of your money through this recent dip, **buy and hold shares until management signals an end to high dividend distributions or the supply chain disruption abates, whichever occurs first**.  **My Position:**  * 1800 shares * 6 ITM Covered Calls S-50 * 6 ATM Covered Calls S-58 * 600 shares uncovered, exposed to potential upside  # BUSINESS OVERVIEW  **What does ZIM do?** \- ZIM is a large marine shipping company that delivers products around the globe via leased and to a lesser extent, owned charter ships.  **How does ZIM make money?** \- ZIM generates revenue by charging freight fees (mostly at market rates, for now) for marine transportation of goods and materials and nets a profit after paying costs related to mid to long term leased and owned charter ships, fuel costs, and labor.  ***Recent Developments***  * ***Aug 2021*** *- ZIM began to distribute dividends on a quarterly basis equal to 20% of net income.  In addition,* ***the Company intends to distribute a special dividend once a year which will bring the total annualized dividend payout to 30-50% of net income***\*. On Jan 21, the CEO affirmed this policy and mentioned that the board will \*consider\* a share buyback program.\* * ***Jan 2022*** *- The CEO announced a slight shift in strategy to lock in* [*12-36 month freight contracts*](https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/international-freight-shipping/new-market-dynamics-driving-demand-freight-futures_20211223.html) *related to US-Asia trade routes assuming contract rates are reasonable compared to expected future freight rates. These contracts will be based on demand (order size) and customer creditworthiness. ZIM is planning to apply this strategy to a number of charter ships it currently leases as well. The Company's goal is to lock in a "spread" on up to 50% of its total trade volumes which will allow ZIM to maintain a moderately high level of profitability should freight rates begin to fall while still capitalizing on inflated spot rates relating to other trade routes in the meantime.*  # The Ongoing Supply Chain Disruption  I'm going to assume everyone here knows there are substantial issues with the global supply chain. Thanks to the current bottleneck, freight rates are sky high and ZIM and other marine shippers are generating record profits. To be brief, the key factors driving the disruption are:  * Record high demand (particularly from the U.S.) resulting from massive stimulus in 2020 * Slow supply catch-up given a near total shut-down of the global supply chain in 2020 * Global dependence on a relatively small number of overseas manufacturers * Labor shortages, port congestion, and poor logistics throughout the global supply chain network * Lack of effective global policies in place to help actively alleviate the disruption  For those who are not savvy on the subject, there is much discussion to be had on the supply chain bottleneck so I've included additional sources for you to look into at the end of this DD.  # FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  **Historical &amp; Projected Financials**  I'm copy/pasting estimates as I mostly agree with Bloomberg especially on the 2021 estimates as those should be quite accurate given how close we are to FYE 2021. Effects of the supply chain disruption are expected to persist through the rest of 2022 but Bloomberg is pricing in an inevitable decrease in freight rates which will lower ZIM's margins. This is evidenced by the peak in margins expected for FYE 2021 followed by a reversion to levels reported in the LTM Sep 30, 2021 financials:  |**amts in USD Millions**|**LTM SEP 30, 2021**|**FYE 2021 Est.**|**FYE 2022 Est.**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Revenue|$8,623|$10,538|$10,487| |EBITDA / *Margin %*|$4,455 / *51.7%*|$6,368 / *60.4%*|$5,761 / *54.9%*| |Free Cash Flow / %|$2,575 / *29.9%*|$3,967 / *37.7%*|$3,411 / *32.5%*|  *Note that while margins may at some point fall to levels seen pre 2021, the purpose of this trade is to collect a very high yield as long as it's offered to shareholders (until the global supply chain normalizes) while enjoying some substantial potential upside in the stock price based on valuations of ZIM's industry peers.*  # MULTIPLES ANALYSIS  ***Note***\*: The metrics shown below should be considered the most relevant when conducting a multiples analysis. For the sake of conciseness of this DD, if you want to know why enterprise value and free cash flow ratios are used versus the frequently referenced P/E, P/S, etc, see the references I've included at the end.\*  |METRIC|LTM SEP 30, 2021|Based on est. FYE DEC 31, 2021| |:-|:-|:-| |EV/Revenue|1.1x|0.4x| |EV/EBITDA|2.1x|0.6x| |Debt/EBITDA|0.6x|0.4x| |Net Debt/EBITDA|0.1x|No Net Debt| |**EV/FCF (preferred to P/E)**|**2.1x**|**0.9x**| |***FCF/EV (FCF Yield)***|***47.1%***|***107.9%***|  **Assumptions for FYE Dec 31, 2021**  * Bloomberg estimates for Revenue, EBITDA, and FCF are used * No change in debt for simplicity (some debt will surely be paid down but you can see why it doesn't matter for the observed period) * Enterprise Value assumes no change in stock price  For the uninitiated, these financials and multiples are OUTSTANDING for a marine shipping company or any company for that matter. The FCF Yield (FCF/EV - my preferred substitute to P/E) demonstrates how much actual cash (versus reported Net Income) will be available to shareholders relative to the enterprise value of the company (versus P or market cap which doesn't account for debt). Based on this metric, **we can reasonable conclude that ZIM is considerably undervalued even compared to its peers.**  Speaking of peers, let's see how ZIM's financial strength holds up against the rest of the industry.  # Comparables  Aside from a relatively high P/B (mostly due to ZIM's **215% ROE for LTM Sep 30, 2021**), ZIM's multiples are clearly superior to its comps. If we apply the means of key multiples (circled above), EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, and P/BV to ZIM's valuation, we can estimate a more appropriate stock price than what it's currently trading at. Note that while using P/BV seems to only serve the purpose of lowering ZIM's price target, let's assume there is a possibility ZIM's value could revert to the mean P/BV of the industry and consider its use as an attempt to be more conservative when estimating the stock price. I would typically use FCF/EV as well but the difference between ZIM and its comps is laughable and would only create an unrealistic amount of skew in the multiples valuation (as if that isn't already apparent in the figures below).  |VALUATION METHOD|Price Target|Applied Weighting| |:-|:-|:-| |EV/Revenue (3.6x mean)|$259|*30%*| |EV/EBITDA (5.5x mean)|$204|*30%*| |P/BV (4.0x mean)|$23|*40%*| |FINAL PRICE TARGET|**$148**|*100%*|  THAT'S A BIT RIDICULOUS. So let's attempt to be even more conservative and consider the possibility that the supply chain bottleneck diminishes sooner than expected, resulting in a lower expected cash flow for 2022. To be *very* conservative, we'll **apply a 30% margin of safety**:  # Multiples based Price Target w/30% MoS: $103.60  Finally, let's look at the expected dividend and include that in our calculation of potential profit. We'll use a sensitivity analysis to see what we can expect based on estimated profits and the proposed 30-50% annualized dividend:  Based on results in line with Bloomberg's estimates and accounting for the $2 and $2.5 dividend payments already distributed, we can expect the 4Q dividend to be anywhere from $3 to $14 per share\*\*.\*\* As I prefer to be conservative, let's assume the actual **4Q dividend will be close to $11 at the 30% payout ratio**. Let's assume the same for the current year and we can **expect total dividends for 2022 to amount to $9-10 per share**...  # Expected 4Q + FY 2022 Div per Share: $20 or more  # RISKS  * Easing Supply Chain Disruption Over Time (inevitable at some point) - Estimated timeframe unknown but expected by the industry to last until at least 2023. Will result in decreasing freight rates and lower profits for ZIM. * Substantial Drop in Demand in 2022 - Could result from drop in U.S. consumer purchasing power (which remains high despite inflation) or a global economic crisis. * Active Clearing of Distribution Bottleneck (highly unlikely) - May result from efficient domestic and foreign policy (lmao) addressing current congestion of marine shipping and land transportation of goods.  &amp;#x200B;  # TL;DR - PT of $104 w/expected Div of $20+ for 100% 1-Yr Gains  * The supply chain bottleneck will persist for another year * ZIM will yield massive profits on share upside and 30-50% dividend payout * **Recommended trade based on risk tolerance:**  |RISK TOLERANCE|STRATEGY| |:-|:-| |Classical Economist Boomer Virgin|Buy &amp; Hold Shares w/100% Covered Calls| |Game Recognize Game|Buy &amp; Hold Shares, OTM CCs on 33-50% of pos| |Poor Retard Margin Called Last Week|Just fkn buy the shares|  Now buy some shares, wait for fat profits, relax, sit back, and listen to some [good music like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_XJ_s5IsQc) because apparently [that makes the markets go up](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X21003718?via%3Dihub).  &amp;#x200B;  Sources:  * [The Hill - What you need to know about the supply chain bottlenecks](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/576670-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-supply-chain-bottlenecks) * [JOC.com on spot rates](https://www.joc.com/port-news/loss-effective-capacity-responsible-record-spot-rates_20210907.html) * [CNBC Interview of Mandarin Shipping CEO on Supply Chain Disruption Timeline](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/supply-chain-bottlenecks-will-take-time-to-resolve-shipping-firm-ceo.html) * [Contributing Factors to the Supply Chain Disruption (from June 2021)](https://poole.ncsu.edu/thought-leadership/article/supply-chain-bottlenecks-will-likely-continue-for-the-remainder-of-the-year/) * [A previous DD post from a fellow ZIM bull](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rpg7n4/zim_offers_exceptional_value_and_several_upcoming/) (kudos to u/Thereian) * [FCF/EV - The Best Predictor of Stock Price Performance](https://newacademyoffinance.com/best-screener-stock-price-performance/) * [The Power of Free Cash Flow Yield](https://www.paceretfs.com/media/pacer_perspective_may2016.pdf) * [Free Cash Flow to Enterprise Value Backtest (2000-2015)](https://www.fatpitchfinancials.com/2632/free-cash-flow-enterprise-value-backtest/) * [Supply Chain Bottlenecks and Inflation: The Role of Semiconductors](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2021/12/16/supply-chain-bottlenecks-and-inflation-the-role-of-semiconductors)
498	0	Back in September of last year [I made a call that what‚Äôs playing out now, would](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwvrsi/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/):  The TLDR being: inflation was going to run hotter than expected, bond yields would move up, stocks would have to come down, growth stocks would get destroyed and the fed wouldn‚Äôt be able to come to the rescue because inflation tied their hands. I suggested value, shorting bond yields and buying internationally. I predicted this would start soon and accelerate early-mid 2022.  I named this upcoming event \*\*‚ÄúThe Great Wheeze‚Äù\*\* - a slow slump based on liquidity exiting.   The response back then was this was crazy talk. Inflation was seen as mostly transitory, it‚Äôd peak at 5ish%. Markets were pricing in a couple of hikes (now it's 7 this year). Stocks went on a big Santa rally, value was cheap, NASDAQ was firing on all cylinders.  Investors, hedge funds, central banks and more didn‚Äôt know what was up. But a kid from the bush did. Told you so üòé  \-----------  First let‚Äôs have a look at some of the friendly things people had to say 5 months ago:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I wonder during how many bubbles throughout history has this theory has been suggested and has it ever once played out?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Ivy league economists: "yeah we really don't know. Its impossible to predict a timeline for such things with any degree of accuracy. Here is a 500 page peer reviewed book to prove our points." Dude on reddit: " I've figured it out! T minus 12 months. Guaranteed. Here is 2 paragraphs of garbage to prove my point."  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You have no idea what you're talking about and are probably watching too many YouTube videos. I don't know what I'm talking about either, so let's both shut up.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;What an absolute joke of a post. You don‚Äôt even understand basic yield formulas.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Try WSB for starting your own meme, take your amateur analysis there as well. To everyone else, steer clear of anyone who claims "certainties" like this, **ALWAYS**. This guy is leaving out many variables which cannot possibly be predicted and is grossly over-simplifying something as complex as a year+ forecast.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;High inflation will not happen. The Fed doesn‚Äôt control it and its appearance is absolutely not a certainty ; that is what the market is seeing and you‚Äôre not.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The inflation we are seeing now is purely aggregate demand based, mostly due to high demand and supply chain issues and shortages and the tell tale sign of this is unequal increases  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;You lost me at certain parts but I admire the confidence  \-------------------------  So anyway here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen next. This is barring any major black swan.   *Processing img zad1lu8xqbj81...*  \-----------------  Key Themes for 22 and beyond.  We‚Äôre entering into a couple years of stagnant growth, shrinking liquidity, increasing real interest rates and declining multiples. **You can‚Äôt price in excess or draining liquidity**, liquidity is the tide that all ships rest on.   **The economy is not strong** like Powell, Biden and much of the media crowd say. Blowout deficits and QE have temporarily plastered over underlying weakness.   **Inflation will peak shortly**, but will stabilise higher than pre-COVID (4-5%) for an extended period of time (years). Interest rates will still be negative in real terms and so much cash is floating out there. Central banks will have to be more hawkish going forward, so if the market crashes they'll do less.  At the end of the day the Fed and other central banks are in a bind. They won‚Äôt be able to increase interest rates above 3-4% to actually fight it. Even if they could, it‚Äôd cause a recession.   **So the only solution is for developed markets is to devalue their currency.** This means extended inflation in developed markets, strengthening emerging market currencies. The era of exporting our inflation to the USD hungry 3rd world is over. [You can already see EM currencies starting to edge up](https://au.investing.com/indices/msci-intl-em-currency).  \----------------  How to play it?  First, **Russia won‚Äôt invade Ukraine**, Putin will consolidate his holdings in the rebel regions but won‚Äôt go as far as to get hit with real sanctions. A lot of fuss and then things die down. Russian stocks are getting crushed, this is probably close to the absolute bottom so load up on $RSX. Hold for 6 months and make 30%, $RUSL will do better.  With declining multiples and weak customers almost all assets are going to suffer. I think it‚Äôs going to be very difficult for the next couple years to do well in anything.   If a 30 PE company growing at 10%/year falls to a 20 PE; it will take 5 years to grow back to even. Rapid growth can negate multiple compression if your entry point is attractive enough.  Growth is going to get oversold, but be careful of what type of growth you buy as most will still struggle. Growth is the answer not value.  Emerging markets are the place to find small, fast growing companies at low valuations. As the inequalities between rich and poor nations are arbitraged away it is a certainty that EM will outperform developed significantly in the long run. Developed markets have mistaken multiple expansion for strength.  Emerging market, smallcap growth in sectors insulated from weaker developed consumption is the sweet spot. Buy in the next 6 months. Look outside China. India, Vietnam, Egypt are all good. India probably the safest but most expensive.  So anyway, best of luck. If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôll come back and cop it.
107	1	The US markets are not efficient. The US markets are a wealth maintenance tool for the 1%.They won't see this market go to shit. It just won't happen.  Who are they? They're your senators, CEOs, big donors, hedge fund managers, Wall Street, members of the fed (until very recently). The same people setting policy are the biggest beneficiaries!  Understand that the US markets are not efficient at all. The fed is just here to ensure that the markets are not overly roused.  This rate hike is a joke if we're being honest considering inflation outlook and look just how difficult it was to do a bloody 25bps hike. Lol. The poor and lower middle class will suffer for inflation just to make the equity market stay afloat.  This is our system.
767	1	Over the past week of trading $SENS has jumped up big time because of pending approval for their 180 day glucose monitoring system. Since Jan 28th, it is up 55.37%. A lot of people are suspecting big buyers getting in because of approval taking place this week. I think it is coming this week and just wanted to share this play with you. If enough buys come in, with a catalyst like FDA approval, I don‚Äôt think it would be crazy to see $10+ a share, or even 20 with a squeeze. Not financial advice, just something I have recently came across this past week. Hope all is well!

This is nothing more than what we as "serious" investors who to show off our losses, and our unique love to see Good Ol' Boy Jim Cramer with his spot on stock tips.  Just a reminder if you have donated any "cyber money" or other funds well done....A world without Putin and his minions that are deep in hedge fund banking, I see this as one way forward to screw the system and put my money to use besides Jimmy Cramer's investors club. Who the f--%k gives that guy money.... just a rant...take it as you will. Enjoy your week and may the gods of the stonks sink Putin and his minions.

147	1	The way I see it, a goal of achieving $100,000 in short term capital gains is not complicated. All I, or anyone, has to do, is start with $500 and make:  ‚Ä¢ 13  50% gains ‚Ä¢ 29  20% gains ‚Ä¢ 38  15% gains ‚Ä¢ So on and so forth  Starting out, I dropped below $500 a few times, using 1 and 0DTE options of course. My goal was to sell / take profit at -30% / +50%, but this proved too difficult to do consistently, with theta working against me.  I switched it up and started selling contracts, instead with the goal of +15% or nothing selling 1 and 0DTE credit spreads and iron condors. Capitalizing on market fear right now is easy, and capturing premiums this high may be a once in several years opportunity.  Last week I took extra risk and doubled my initial $500 to ~1,100, aka five 15% gains. Five down, thirty-three to go. I plan to follow through the operation by exclusively using theta gang strategies. I will be selling 1/0dte QQQ options 3 times a week. If I succeed every trade, I will be up $100k in 3 months.  I‚Äôll be making periodic posts about my progress.

438	1	NASDAQ100 futures are currently down 0.8% following Thursday‚Äôs wild reversal which saw US equities recover from heavy losses at the open. The technology sector led the bounce as the beginning of the Russian invasion seemed to cool bets on a 50bps hike in March.   Markets have been pricing-in an increasingly hawkish Fed this year, but with the prospect of a larger-scale conflict clouding economic outlook, the US central bank might look to begin their tightening cycle on a tamer note. Given the amount of bearish pressure tech stocks have already come under in recent weeks, any chance of a more modest approach from the Fed is likely to cause $NDX to rebound over the short-term, and potentially form some sort of a low at the current levels.   However, it is still too early judge the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have, and with PCE data also due on Friday, speculation for an aggressive policy approach could quickly return. Speaking earlier, Fed member Waller stated that there is still a strong case for a 50bps hike in March if the economy shows signs of overheating. Therefore, $NDX, and the broader market, could possibly see losses accelerate into the weekend if tonight‚Äôs inflation print is hot enough.   It‚Äôll be interesting to see how the market reacts to the data release, as well as the situation in Eastern Europe and how the West chooses to respond. Of course, all trading carries risk, and both these factors need to be closely monitored.
409	0	Hey guys, title says pretty much everything. He basically was trying to seem like he understood what Putins real Plan was and claimed that it was pure unnecessary hysteria from the Americans to order the evacuation of all of its citizens and wrote a pretty long text about it. I don't remember much else expect that the most up voted comment was someone suggesting to post it in r/politics. I just wanted to remind him that he was wrong in case he hasn't noticed yet üòÖ Thanks guys.

687	1	I've been collecting and publishing data on stock trading by US politicians. Last week I shared a post showing some of the best recent trades by US politicians. To satisfy the WallStreetBets loss porn fetish, I also wanted to share a list of some of the worst-time recent moves.  Top 5 worst moves  1. **Purchase of up to $100K worth of short-dated tech calls in early January by Representative James Langevin.** Langevin bought an assortment of call options in tickers such as $BABA, $RIVN, $FB, and $SQ. Needless to say, these contracts have not exactly been printing money while tech has been getting slaughtered. You can see the full list of transactions [here](https://twitter.com/QuiverCongress/status/1491421702122663937), along with specifics on the expiries and strikes prices of the various call options.     2. **Purchase of up to $50K in $FB call options with a $340 strike on December 31st by Representative Deborah Ross.** While the Jan. 20, 2023 expiry date on these contracts gives Rep. Ross some time for $FB to recover from its historic collapse last week, it was still a spectacularly poorly timed move.      3. **Purchase of $RBLX stock on November 19th by Rep. James Banks.** Banks bought Roblox stock on the same day it hit its all-time high price of $141. In the less than three months since then, it has dropped over 50%.      4. **Sale of up to $65K Activision ($ATVI) by Rep. David McKinley, weeks prior to announcement of acquisition by Microsoft**. The stock would jump over 30% following the news.     5. **Sale of Cerner ($CERN) by Rep. Peter Welch, weeks prior to announcement of acquisition by Oracle.** Similar to the above, $CERN has risen over 20% since Welch's sale. It seems like some politicians would benefit from a ban on trading, in order to protect them from their own paper-hand behavior.
879	0	I played NDX today, VIX was looking very ready to launch (and it was because you can see it did). I bought a put early in the day and a call to hedge. I knew I should've cashed out when the spread was getting $1,500. Instead I got [slammed](https://ibb.co/72NS2sF) by the range.   I wanted a 15125 call that order took too long to go through and the price went too high at the time. Settled for what I got since I believe it would move 1 way or another. Didn't work, [good game.](https://ibb.co/Dztm23D)

Sooner or later, real traders will understand that we already won the war. If not for robinhood, many retail traders would not have gotten a stock to begin with and become the trader they are today. Robinhood opened many avenues for the retail trader.   - No trading fees - margin - easy to use options chain - debit cards - dopamine every time your smooth brain makes a trade  $hood is severely undervalued imo. Robinhood has the best user interface and user experience of any trading app out there. I transferred to fidelity after the memestock mania and recently transferred back because fidelity fucking sucks too. All trading platforms suck but robinhood sucks a little less.   - They now have liquid funds to survive the next stock mania - wenwallets coming soon - they are adding features such as options watchlist -etc  Their market cap is 1/4 of what it should be with almost the same amount of users.  This is not financial advice. $hood to the mooooon.

131	1	First off I'm just as retarded as any of you and my macro takes are especially bad. That said, I might have a thought no one is considered yet.  China's Winnie the Pooh asked the Fed not to raise interest rates two months ago: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/xi-jinping-warns-fed-against-hiking-interest-rates-11642502735  That's because he started on a path to consolidate power in Beijing, but ran into an unexpected problem. Earlier than expected tightening by the Fed while China is already cracking down would challenge Yuan parity. This was already happening in 2019 when the Fed was raising rates: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/yuan-falling-china-currency-manipulator-struggling-secretly-858981  Plus given the new league of self sabotaging nations (Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, etc) is trying to challenge dollar hegemony, I wonder if JPow shocks us tomorrow to (among other priorities) challenge Yuan parity.   It is unlikely, but if by chance they assess that such a shock will increase domestic labor force participation (which lowers inflation), they have another reason (dollar hegemony) to do it. In fact, I think the Fed has been shocking markets since November to improve labor force participation. Here's my take on that and a pretty graph to show that it is working:  https://twitter.com/moazzam0_reddit/status/1491974994313859089?t=_U5Px6yKJKL21o0aIE3UlQ&amp;s=19  Would they risk recession? No, I think supply driven inflation and bottlenecks are so sudden and drastic that they're limiting growth. That's why I think we have stagflation. So if the Fed sees labor force participation as their solution to this supply side inflation, it makes sense to shock markets some more. Plus they get the bonus of making Winnie the Pooh tear up when he realizes his economy can't grow 5.5% this year no matter how much he fudges the data.  No I'm not holding puts.

219	0	Ok retards here‚Äôs the deal. If it hasn‚Äôt already happened, the price of the metals in every single coin of our worthless currency is gonna skyrocket and become more valuable than the coin itself. In order to capitalize on this, you need to withdraw all of the money you haven‚Äôt already lost on pltr calls and puts on the Russian stock market and request coins from the banks. They literally can‚Äôt say no.   Once you have the coins all you have to do is smelt them into ingots of nickel, copper, and probably aluminum or something (I didn‚Äôt take the time to research what metal quarters are made of), and wait until the metal you have shoots up in price.   Then you sell those ingots to an even bigger retard and have them buy the top. It‚Äôs pretty much a sure fire way to make enough money to stop having to give handjobs behind your local Wendy‚Äôs dumpster until the next meme stock comes along.

Either we make her broke by having our karma rub off on her or we all get rich as fuck.

415	1	The recent news of a Russian missile hitting an massive oil depot near Kyiv will send a shock in the oil markets in the coming future. This could be a starting factor of a pump in the oil price. Also even though Biden‚Äôs administration has stated they don‚Äôt want to disrupt the purchases of oil that they get from Russia. I think he will be pressured into stopping it. I am just a retard degenerate who will probably predict the opposite of what is stated. Trust or don‚Äôt idk. üöÄ

Theoretically, there is buying with medium to long-term investment horizons while the market is underpriced.    Alternatively, the largest DIX ever might be different this time where there is opportunistic shorting in anticipation of a sure bet.  Is there anyone interested in DIX who knows how to handle this?
143	1	Hey guys, just a little bit more technical analysis I've been doing lately. Recently I've been looking at home Depot! First I'll get into the stocks movement as of late.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/oDmTVvNi  Seen in the chart above, HD is approaching a long standing resistance which goes back to early 2022. It has been showing some strength recently forming higher lows in the past few weeks. It also had a strong trading session today as it stayed green as the market dropped. On the daily chart, the rsi is still near the oversold end of the spectrum and the macd on both the daily and 4hr timelines has cycles upwards implying strength. One final thing to note is that the stock successfully defended the 310 area in the past couple days and has since been moving upward. Now, a look at lumber prices recently.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/HI99vz64  Looking at the chart above, it can be seen that though lumber has been on the decline as of late, it bounced hard on uptrend support today. This bounce will hopefully continue with a broader bounce in commodities as the week goes on. With the increase in lumber prices, it is likely that companies like HD and LOWS will both benefit as they are both major dealers of lumber.  All things considered, if broader markers stay somewhat solvent, I believe that both home depot and Lowe's stock with make for good investments in the coming weeks. HD looks a bit better technically and also has a better entry point as of now.  Thanks for listening!  Positions: HD 4/14 320c

926	1	I‚Äôve been in this position since $56, but AFRM is going to pump until earnings. I recommend Feb 18 $60 or $70 calls. They have huge OI and the volume is good as well.   AFRM is down from an ATH of $160+  They aren‚Äôt worth $160 but I easily see this pumping to high-mid $80s when they blast through earnings. Way oversold.  Pros of the trade:  -They have a ton of institutional ownership.  -Oversold af -Going to pump on earnings due to Apple doing well (partnership) -Lost all value from Amazon partnership pump -Economic Growth last quarter is due for an inventible growth in consumer spending (higher earnings/volume) -Double Bottomed and solid resistance  Cons of the trade:  -Company not Profitable yet (who is?) -Had a decent past few days so IV is high -Might be a quick flip -Fuck you   This is a suggestion. I‚Äôm retarded and already balls deep in the trade so obviously a pump is good for me.   Good luck, retards!

"Wall Street used to love a company that grew fast and lost a ton of money. Now, they just feel total contempt for them," he said.   &gt;   &gt;Bumble: Cramer had few words about Bumble, which closed at $18.08 on Friday, well below its 52-week high of $76.49. "Maybe romance is dead," he said.   &gt;   &gt;Stitch Fix (SFIX): Stitch Fix is the third stock reporting earnings on Tuesday ‚Äî along with MongoDB and Bumble ‚Äî in bear market territory, Cramer said, adding that he's watching to see if they might find a floor and be worth a buy.   &gt;   &gt;Campbell Soup ($CPB): Campbell has to get their raw costs down, but the company "will fly" if it manages to report even moderate gains, Cramer said.   &gt;   &gt;CrowdStrike ($CRWD): Cramer said he expects Crowdstrike to report a strong quarter. However, its performance won't matter if inflation spikes that same day and hurts its stock, Cramer said.   &gt;   &gt;Ulta Beauty ($ULTA): Cramer praised Ulta Beauty's consistent performance, adding that the company "has the best chance of roaring higher next week." He cautioned that the company is not "a cheap stock."   &gt;   &gt;DocuSign ($DOCU): Cramer said that DocuSign is suffering from being known as a "Covid stock." "It's a very good company with a very bad stock," he said.   &gt;   &gt;Rivian ($RIVN): Calling Rivian "a poster child" for western electric vehicle companies that have been "losers for ages now," Cramer said that the company has lost its novelty.   &gt;   &gt;Wheels Up: Cramer said he'll be watching to see if the private jet company can get its stock up on Thursday. "I bet they'll tell their story loud and clear," Cramer said, adding that it will be useless if the company doesn't actually turn a profit.   &gt;   &gt;eBay ($EBAY): "It's a pretty clear story about an exchange where you can sell anything. For me, that's worth something," Cramer said of the e-commerce giant.   &gt;   &gt;AT&amp;T ($T): The company said it will give updates on its strategies for business and capital allocation during its analyst &amp; investor day. Cramer said he plans to listen to the call for positive signs but is skeptical. "This is a company with uniquely terrible management ‚Äî we're talking 'Wall of Shame' bad ‚Äî and I have no desire to touch it," he said.  Is he going to be on the money this week or out of the money? I personally may inverse some of his opinions depending on my own DD.

This is the PERFECT time for a market crash. This is 100% NOT funds loading up for new all-time highs on consumer panic.

I would avoid weed stocks, tech stocks, really all stocks in general.

Obviously cameras are not the only product that they sell, but they control 45% of the camera industry which is bigger than Sony, nikon, and fuji combined. This is not as important as it seems because total share of the market means nothing because you need to compare it to a companies market cap to get a more accurate idea of how heavily invested they are in a product or sector. The thing that is troubling for me when looking at the stock is the history of revenue and how it has been going down in the last decade or so. A company like Canon, that controls such a large share in the camera sector, having a dwindling revenue is a good indicator that the whole camera market is and will continue to be on a decline. Here is the annual revenue, in millions, for Canon from 2010 until 2020 2020 $29,706 2019 $33,058 2018 $35,963 2017 $36,312 2016 $31,294 2015 $35,409 2014 $35,409 2013 $38,433 2012 $43,497 2011 $45,608 2010 $45,764  The revenue has been trending downwars ever since the year 2011. There was an event in 2010 that had a major effect on the whole entire camera sector. The release of the iPhone 4. All the previous models of the iPhone did have cameras and built apples name up but what came out on the iPhone 4 was what eliminated part of the need for a camera for many people. The addition of a front facing camera made it easy for people to take selfies and record themselves instead of using a camcorder or other type of camera. With almost all new phones implementing front facing cameras and upgrading the specs on the front and back facing cameras, it almost entirely removed the need for a physical camera for the average person when taking photos. With the prices of modern iphones increasing to close to and above $1000, it made it impractical to carry around or use a high-end camera that would cost the same amount as a brand new phone that could already fulfill the users needs.  Since Canon's revenue has been going down so much and with the need for cameras going down it is obvious that the price of a Canon share will continue to go down if nothing major happens to the camera industry. The best bet for this IMHO would be longterm puts that would be eventually exercised in two to three years that would not be effected by short term news that might make Canon rise a few percent at once.   Quick reminder this is not financial advice
751	1	With the energy sector doing ‚Äúwell‚Äù in comparison with everything else in the market, I started looking at prior crashes and noticed a trend that showed the energy sector peaking a few months after the S&amp;P had started the downturn but had not yet crashed‚Ä¶ the everything tanks together. Anyone else seeing the same trend? It would make sense, as people try to find a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù place to park their money‚Ä¶ until everything collapses.  The market looks like it‚Äôs hanging by a thread and just needs a mini catalyst ( Thursdays CPI reading?) to send it lower.
356	0	I'm just thinking of possible outcomes for this who Ukraine thing. One possible outcome is Russia calls it quits and withdraws. The most serious sanctions would be lifted right away because "the Russia citizens don't deserve to suffer because of Putins actions". Maybe they even cede Crimea as reparations and all the sanctions get lifted. What is the play? What can we buy now that will rocket in say &lt;2 months if this scenario were to play out? SPY is barely concerned about this. I know it will rise but I want some sector or company specific plays. What will see the biggest gains?

Since Wall Street money is balls deep in Crammer‚Äôs pockets and the guy is a Wall Street veteran spitting out shit to help his friends in Wall Street, then why doesn‚Äôt someone smart create a reverse Crammer index that tracks Crammer‚Äôs recommendations and does the opposite.

Big Tech smashes earnings as usual, and the market is recovering.  &amp;#x200B;  in conclusion, don't overestimate the intelligence of the permabulls. they will gladly sell their kidneys for half a share of $TSLA. there will be a time, maybe, when the markets will truly correct. we are not there,  &amp;#x200B;  yours truly,  \- üåà üêª

I‚Äôm just going to quit doing options and buy yugioh cards, for a few reasons.  1. If I buy Ford calls, the stock plummets and I lose all my money.

472	0	Everything about the economy that was done after covid was like the titanic's captain manuovering away from iceberg after noticing the danger. The countries that could empower from the situation got stronger, the ones with such fond of humanity got busted. The brrrrrs and so called mandates didn't really work (how do they, when the Govts wait for the long weekend to end to begin the restrictions). What the world saw was a tangible loss of human resources who worked day and night to keep the economy booming. Now many of them are either burned out or resting in peace brought upon by covid. The alternative machine learning models were only intelligent enough to recommend goods that were already bought.  Intelligent people escaped from reality into metaverse. Whoever got strengthened are having a fun party now.

I guess I should also add that I'm retarded enough  to bet it all on black if the right opportunity comes along!
863	0	Last Friday, Lord Tendie appeared before me. He said, ‚ÄúThou shalt not short thy enemy, Ye must forgive and call upon thy neighbor.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean my Lord?‚Äù He pointed at me, then my phone. The screen illuminated green, and my Robinhood account had been blessed with over $1 million!  Suddenly, I woke up and sprung into action. I opened my Robinhood app. Hood down 15% and my 1 day call options REKT. I envisioned myself cuck‚Äôd, working at fucking McDonalds. My wife saying, ‚ÄúYou smell like French fries.‚Äù   Miserably, I went about my day replaying the trade in my head. Giving up on trading once for all like I do every Friday. Shamefully, I log in at the close to YOLO some 1 day SPY options and to my surprise my account had doubled! Hood was now up 10% with 6X the avg volume. I had witnessed a miracle.   Once again, I hear, ‚ÄúThough shalt not short thy enemy, Ye must forgive and call upon thy neighbor.‚Äù I get it! Robinhood is not my enemy, the Lord wants me to buy calls! I do what any retard would do, and jump into as many out of the money leaps as I can before the close.   Over the weekend, I had my doubts. Did I just blow the last of my savings on another stupid trade? Lord, show me a sign. This time silence. Am I going crazy? No, not crazy. Autistic.  Monday arrives, Hood down 4%. I open the Robinhood app ready to paper hand another trade when all of sudden my calls PUMP! Hood closes up another 10%. The sign I was looking for, I‚Äôm a believer!   Thank you Lord for guiding me on this quest. Bless all thee that follow thy message with tendie's.   \-Amen
955	0	True retard here... hear me out and tell me how stupid I am.  Been together with this woman since more than 20 years as her boyfriend. She and her husband lived together for maybe 2 years then she kicked him out and I moved in. They never signed their divorce papers. Now that coved hit she stopped working completely and I have to support her 100%, even when covid would be history she doesn't want to work anymore. I'm using more money for our bills than I earn from my fulltime dayjob. Luckily I made some good trades last year and was even thinking about quitting my job. Before that she used to ridicule me how stupid I was not taking profit and loosing it all again.  My only pleasure now is to sit in my home office and watch the charts while playing half assed my guitar (while I gently weep). This shit is all true, someone please put me out of misery..

729	1	I get Meta is evil and whatever, but if you short the Zuck, you're gonna end up getting creamed with a 100% certainty.  You fucking idiots are all the same. You retards have just become the largest cliqu√© of confident fools in the world. You just follow whatever meme wave is going on, without taking half a second considering how to actually make money. This meta shit is the equivalent of thinking with your cock to make investments.  I have not heard a single good justification for Meta being at the price it is at. At the price it is currently at, you would think people are expecting a meteor to hit their headquarters. They had slightly subpar quarter and FB daily user numbers are starting to plateau, most likely due to the fact that 1 third of the \*\*WORLD POPULATION\*\* is already a daily user. What's driving the stock down right now is purely panic, hatred and other emotions you would expect from a teenage girl that just had her first period. Congratulations on being a part of that, btw.  Meta is a powerhouse conglomerate with multiple pivoting possibilities, political connections, vaults of backup balance and cutting edge R&amp;D teams made up of the most wicked IT virgins on earth. They have some of the best AI tech in the world, next to Google, and they are, like it or not, currently the biggest player in the VR industry. Biggest of all though, they own all the fucking data. They know how many times you jerk of to tranny porn everyday. They know how many anal fissures your father got last year from getting pegged, and I fucking promise you, those things are not anywhere NEAR the most interesting of things they gather on a daily basis.  Do you guys really believe for one second, that any and all governments aren't jizzing their pants in ecstasy over the fact that they get to have access to all of this sweet, juicy, data?  Europe is calling the most desperate bluff, ever, when they say they don't care. It's like when that kid in highschool got called gross by the popular girl and then starts pretending like he doesn't care "I don't like her anyway, haha, she's just a bitch anyway, haha...". They only pull shit like that, because they know Meta \*\*won't\*\* pull out of Europe, but if Zuck actually had the cojones to go all the fucking way, Macron and Merkel would, without a fucking doubt, eat their own excrement on live television and then apologize to lord Facebook for their insolence, just to keep the social media they know they can access in their nations. It's a move to make people believe the EU is actually confident and powerful enough to stand up to corporations, but when it comes to the bottom-line, they are really kind of their bitch.  And please don't hit me with that "TikTok is the new social media standard, it is going to replace Meta". First off, TikTok is Chineese, and doesn't give the western governments anything that resembles what Meta offers when it comes to international political advantages or intelligence. With TikTok all data goes to China and kinda fucking stays there. There's a reason why it was nearly banned in the US. TikTok is in a sense a modern day trojan horse, don't kid yourself. Second off, TikTok is gay. Kids are kids, and will like stupid kid shit. I liked Minecraft when I was between the ages of 9 and 13. Do I like Minecraft now? No, it is stupid gay shit. TikTok just can't replace Instagram or Facebook. TikTok is just a mobile dopamine machine, with zero actual practicality. You seem to forget that Instagram is actually essential for some businesses marketing, and Facebook can be essential for selling reused items locally, which is actually some peoples job. I know things like "Marketing" and "Working" are pretty foreign concepts if you're the type of person that eats croutons directly out of your navel and then calls it 'dinner', but it's for real guys, it's not something that just exists in movies.  If you are selling this or investing all of your money in puts at this price, you should really have your personal guardian monitor your finances for you. Going short or buying naked puts on Meta, is the biggest emotional play ever. It's almost bipolar. The 26% drop was already monumental, do you guys seriously expect that they will go bankrupt? Are all of you collectively this daft? They still grew this year and they will certainly continue growing. the only reason their earnings per share don't look phenomenal to someone who is illiterate in finances, is because they have put dialed the development on Metaverse into overdrive. They aren't slowing down, they're just fucking re-investing instead of hoarding, to avoid the drop in revenue from Facebook that is expected to become a problem 2 to 4 years down the line. It's funny because other small shitty companies that focus on growth with negative net income for 5 years + growing liabilities, will usually cause all of you retards to drop your life savings into call options that expires tomorrow.  "durrhh \*\*ITS GROWTH STOCK, NO WORRIES\*\* üöÄüöÄüöÄ"  All that said, the market is never really rational, and Meta might actually hit 200. So I did the smart thing. 100 Long @ 230 with 2 protected 200 puts @ 4.6 for 3/18. I believe some of you will probably make money with your puts, and you will obviously post your gains, most likely convincing some poor fucking idiots, that you are actually correct about Meta. These unfortunate fuckers will then go all in on puts out of FOMO and then subsequently get shit on from every thinkable angle. Good luck explaining to your parents how you lost your entire trust fund betting against the largest social media company in the world.  Now, knowing WSB you will probably all call me gay for Zuckerberg or some other predictable shit, so go the fuck ahead. In the end I won't be the one, actually, getting buttfucked.  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR: Shorting Meta is super retarded, most of you will get creamed and I don't think any of you are very good at financials and are trading with your emotions.
378	0	So I‚Äôve been playing around a little on Robin Hood. Just over 400 total. It‚Äôs 30% stocks, 66% coins, and 4% ETF‚Äôs.   I only add $25 a week to my brokerage account. Keeping things small while I‚Äôm learning the ropes.   Had an idea to take half that coin amount and reinvest it in either stocks or ETF‚Äôs and move the other half to a different platform that‚Äôs linked to my wallet. Is this a good idea? And if so how should I reinvest that half?  Thanks for putting up with a noob question.   Cheers.

These actions will restore investor confidence in the company and attract both income and growth investors.  Don‚Äôt let my calls expire worthless‚Ä¶.  You can say it was your idea‚Ä¶.  Kind regards,

207	1	In case you Malones were down at the Bing eating subs, lemme tell you a couple three things eh?  At the whiff of ECB raising rates faster Italian bonds jumped off the high dive and had a 23bps increase. It is an interesting dynamic of how modern governments are willing to sacrifice the weakest links to tame inflation.  Contrary to popular belief, governments are well aware that inflation is an empire killer. It is a for sure way for incumbents to be ousted from power. And what do incumbents love most? Power. So they will do anything to maintain it.  This is coming off the covid instability, the government will tame inflation when the public truly gets unrestful about it.   Do you really think the average German would have elected a turd with a Charlie Chaplin mustache if all his savings weren't liquidated poof into the air, inflation?
358	1	Positions: I am long shares NTR, considering also going long shares CF.  Disclaimer: This is provided for informational purposes only. This is just the personal view of a random amateur retail trader - a retarded one at that. Do your own independent research before making any investment decision.    #Food Do you like to eat food? I'm gonna guess that you do. Maybe you have noticed your grocery bill is more expensive these days.   Along with many other commodities, food prices have exploded in the past year or so. YOY Corn is +34%, Wheat +51%, Oats +86%, Rough Rice +22.7%, just to name a few. As you might have guessed, it all started with the pandemic. Front month futures for the above four mentioned products: https://i.imgur.com/i22iYU5.png Like many other commodities, supply chain and labor issues have made producing and moving food much more difficult than pre-pandemic. You know about all that.  #Fertilizer The other part of the story is fertilizer. There are 8 billion people on Earth and counting. If they are going to eat something besides each other, we have to grow various crops for them to eat, or to feed to other (non-human) animals that we then eat. Mother Earth can't naturally sustain all these greedy-ass people and their farm animals. So, in order to feed everyone and properly rape Mother Earth to the fullest extent, we must pump her soil full of nutrients in the form of fertilizer.  There are three main necessary nutrients that fertilizer adds to the soil: Nitrogen, phosphates, and potassium. Phosphates and potassium are contained in certain minerals that are mined from the earth. Those would be various phosphate rocks, and for potassium, a mineral called potash.   Nitrogen fertilizer products, on the other hand, are manufactured from ammonia, which itself is derived from air in an extremely energy intensive process called the Haber-Bosch process. Nitrogen is by far the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, about 78% of the air we breathe, but it exists in the extremely stable chemical form N2, and so it requires massive amounts of energy to convert into something chemically useful. To give you an idea of how important this process is, it has been called the "detonator of the population explosion":  &gt; Without ammonia, there would be no inorganic fertilizers, and nearly half the world would go hungry. Of all the [20th] century‚Äôs technological marvels, the Haber‚ÄìBosch process has made the most difference to our survival.  http://www.vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/smil-article-1999-nature7.pdf  The other thing about nitrogen is it must be re-applied much more frequently than potassium and phosphate fertilizers because the nitrogen will evaporate into the air. Those can be applied once every few years, nitrogen must be re-applied with every planting. So any shortages in the market have a bigger impact in the short term.   ##Natural Gas  Ammonia production is critically dependent on natural gas, both as an ingredient and as an energy source. But, as I'm sure you already have heard, there is an energy crisis going on - especially surrounding natural gas. Natural gas prices are through the roof and all indicators are that the price will be going higher.  European NG Prices https://i.imgur.com/oNqACwz.png   &gt;Europe has been hardest hit by fertilizer-plant cutbacks on soaring costs of natural gas used to run them -- and nutrient prices there remain at a record even as the pressure eased in North America. Europe could face a deficit of about 9% of its annual nitrogen-fertilizer needs in the first half, VTB Capital estimates. Food may get even pricier if harvests suffer or crop prices rise.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/crunch-time-for-pricey-fertilizers-squeezing-european-farmers  Many major producers are also limiting or cutting back on production, and farmers particularly in Europe are actually reducing planting acreage because they can't afford the fertilizer cost, or they are spreading it more thinly.  &gt;‚ÄúCoupled with the lack of imported fertilizers, the impact will be felt even more strongly,‚Äù said Romanian fertilizer maker Azomures, which is among those that curbed output. ‚ÄúCrops will suffer in terms of quality and final quantity.‚Äù  The damage hasn't been as bad in the US because we have limited natural gas export capacity, since we pretty much maxed out what we can ship overseas to Europe and Asia, ex-US demand gets saturated, allowing prices to come back down for us. But the damage is being felt in America too.  &gt; In the US, input costs for farmers have gone up with fertilizer prices soaring. The US is the largest producer of corn globally and corn is a highly-fertilizer intensive crop.  &gt; US corn farmers have talked about moving to different crops such as soybeans or reducing their usage of fertilizers in the upcoming planting season if prices continued to be firm.  &gt; Soaring fertilizer prices are also likely to impact Brazil's largest corn crop, which will be planted starting this month.  &gt; An end date to higher fertilizer prices is unknown, American Farm Bureau Federation's economists were quoted saying during their annual convention Jan. 8.  &gt; A report released by Texas A&amp;M University in a January echoed the view, "Regardless of the factors driving the increase in costs, the reality on the ground is that producers are facing the prospect of a huge increase in costs going into the 2022 Spring planting season."  https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/market-insights/blogs/agriculture/011922-fertilizer-costs-natural-gas-prices  ##Trade Restrictions and Geopolitics On top of this (and because of it), in January, China banned export of fertilizer. That takes 25% of nitrogen and phosphate products off the market.   https://www.fb.org/market-intel/too-many-to-count-factors-driving-fertilizer-prices-higher-and-higher  You might also have heard a little bit of a dust-up recently between Russia and Ukraine. This is big deal on multiple fronts.  Russia is the largest producer of nitrogen products at 16.5% of the world market. So with China and Russia, that's about 42% of nitrogen not available to the West. Russia and their little buddy Belarus, who also got sanctioned, together produce about 35% of potash.   Second, Russia provides 25% of natural gas to the world market and 40% to Europe. The sanctions the West slapped Russia with are hitting pretty much everything Russia produces except energy (which is why Putin has the balls to do what he is doing now). But the war has led to many people wary of doing any kind of business with Russia. You have energy supermajors like BP, Shell, Total and Exxon looking at partially or totally divesting out of their Russian assets at massive losses.   https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-28/first-bp-now-shell-big-oil-walks-away-after-decades-in-russia-as-war-rages  Since the sanctions have hit all Russian banks and Russian accounts, including the central bank, that is going to be a major impediment to doing any business in Russian or with Russian counterparts, even if it is unsanctioned.  China has also cut a deal for a new gas pipeline to slurp up all that extra Russian gas the West may or may not want to buy.  https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-russia-china-agree-30-year-gas-deal-using-new-pipeline-source-2022-02-04/  If the war drags on and/or Russia starts acting like even bigger assholes, the West might sack up and start sanctioning Russia's energy exports. We'll see. I kind of think we like brunch and welfare too much for that, who knows?  And on top of even all that, Ukraine is the ‚Äúbreadbasket‚Äù of Europe. It accounts for 12% of global wheat exports, 16% of corn and 18% of barley. This war is certainly going to disrupt that as it drags on, driving food prices even higher. ##Longer Term The geopolitical situation might be resolved in a few months. I don't think the energy crisis is going to change for at least another year. But even longer than that:  To reiterate, people have to eat something. Rich countries are full of selfish people who would prefer spend money on skincare snake oil and VR headsets instead of raising children. So, almost all population growth (as well as economic growth) is going to come from poor and/or developing countries.   But as countries get progressively richer, its people become fat, lazy and decadent, which means their energy and food demands grow. When too many of its people start using words like ‚Äúmarginalized‚Äù and ‚Äúidentity‚Äù and show increasing creativity in their invention of reasons why they deserve an easy life, you will know this process is complete. Up until this point, energy and food demand are highly inelastic and only increase with income, following an S-curve.   https://i.imgur.com/LJFoR1f.png  Once they reach the top of the curve, energy and food per capita demand can relax slightly, but not by much. (This is why rich countries can make modest conservation efforts, which they then they use to justify lecturing poor countries about burning fossil fuels and the like, while still burning orders of magnitude more than them).  Not only does primary crop consumption grow, there is also increasing meat consumption, which means there needs to be even more grain grown to feed those pigs, cows, etc. Grain demand has increased 75% since; notice that the population didn‚Äôt grow 75% since 2000. People are eating more and better food because they aren‚Äôt as poor as they used to be worldwide.   https://i.imgur.com/q0NBHoY.png  S-curve and meat consumption analyses are from http://gorozen.com/research/commentaries/4Q2021_Commentary ##Bear/Sideways Arguments Fertilizer prices already ran up in 2021. Also, if energy and trade restrictions are causing fertilizer prices to skyrocket, causing people to limit crop planting, won‚Äôt that ultimately check the rise in fertilizer prices?   My thesis is that this will happen at first. But a short term reduction in planting acreages will ultimately lead to higher food prices, which, in combination with other pressures on food prices, will keep prices high enough to justify purchasing fertilizers at sky-high prices. Again, people have to eat, and in general nitrogen and phosphate demand is relatively inelastic ‚Äì prices increases cause a little reduction in demand, but not much. The price will ultimately get passed along to the consumers.  Some of this does depend on what happens with the Russia/Ukraine war, but my thesis is mostly driven by the energy crisis and natural gas prices, which as I said I think is not abating any time soon and if anything will get worse in the short to medium term.  #Plays You could gamble on grain futures in the short term. That‚Äôs not really my thing, it‚Äôs too risky for my small pp, and also, gambling on food prices is also gambling in large part on the weather.    I am focused on shares major nitrogen producers, because that seems the most sensitive to the bullish factors mentioned above. The two most dominant nitrogen producers you can buy on an American exchange are Nutrien (NTR) and CF Industries (CF). Together with Yara International ASA of Norway, they seem to dominate this market. The Mosaic Company (MOS) is also allegedly a nitrogen producer but a look at their latest 10-K doesn‚Äôt show any production volume for nitrogen products, so I‚Äôm confused. They do produce large amounts of other fertilizer products though.  I went long shares NTR because they produce a comparable amount of nitrogen products to CF (CF million tons CF (2020) vs. 19 million tons (NTR 2021)), but NTR has exposure to potassium and phosphate markets, whereas CF basically only produces nitrogen. On the other hand CF has had better return on equity in the past 5 years (15% vs. 9%).

You want to make money you have to eventually turn that stuff into money - usually by selling it to someone who believes more in that stuff than you. Coming back to stock for example, regardless of company, one has to sell it to someone else and take their money at the same time to be able to "earn"/"make" money.   The ultimate goal of trading is to take money from someone else. Feels SAD.

That argument of "The market makers won't let your puts print" when they've literally been letting calls print for over a year after the Covid crash is so fucking dumb.  It's like a football team winning the last 20 games, and then people say "Too many people have bet on them, the bookies won't let them win tonight" lol. They don't give a fuck, they make money either way, and MMs are the same.  I do think the market will head downwards, and guess what? If it does, the MMs will still find a way to make money.  Also, it's not a "bear trap" or a "bull trap" every time the price moves up or down 0.1% lol

Joe Manchin ([D-W.Va](https://D-W.Va).), who reiterated his call for the Fed to act to combat the fastest rate of price increases since the early 1980s.  "Inflation should keep everyone on high alert right now," and "the market can't afford it. You can't keep pouring gasoline on the fire. You just can't do it." Manchin said.  Manchin has been warning for months about the impact of U.S. government spending on inflation. Last December, he suspended talks with President Joe Biden on plans to expand social programs and tax increases, citing rising prices.  U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on a television program Sunday that rising prices should be weighed against job growth and President Biden's efforts to mitigate the effects of the new crown epidemic through federal spending. While it's important to address inflation, "it's not right to say that what we're doing is having an impact on inflation.  https://preview.redd.it/6v0m5tac2rh81.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45248c29b627831da405a6c9eaccd6d74fdc1010  Goldman Sachs continues to expect S&amp;P growth but cuts target, forecasts seven rate hikes this year  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists lowered their expectations for U.S. stock market returns this year as the prospect of more aggressive monetary tightening puts pressure on valuations.  The strategists lowered their year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 benchmark index to 4,900 points from 5,100 points. The index closed at 4,418.64 points on Friday.  Despite the less optimistic outlook, it still implies the economy will rise 11 percent from current levels to a record high, though the strategists warned of greater downside risks.  "The macro backdrop is more challenging this year than in 2021," wrote the team, led by David Kostin, "with uncertainty about the path of inflation and Federal Reserve policy. "  The U.S. stock market started the year at a disadvantage as the Fed prepared to close the floodgates of abundant liquidity. It was the abundant liquidity that drove the strong rally in stocks after the outbreak.  https://preview.redd.it/qq3ramvc2rh81.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ebe8b4c6db3a19fe7ef2682f8c217781b10e5f  Soros Spends $10 Billion in Q4 on Tesla's 'Mystery Foe' Rivian  According to Soros Fund Management's 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fund managed by billionaire George Soros purchased nearly 20 million shares of Rivian in the fourth quarter of last year, with a market value of about $2.057 billion, or 12.7 billion yuan, accounting for nearly 30% of its portfolio. The company is the largest long position in Rivian.  Overall, Soros also purchased short options on Kingmaker's Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQ), indicating a bearish stance on technology stocks. He also reduced his holdings in Liberty Broadband-C, Horton Housing, Amazon and others.  Meanwhile, [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) owns 20% of Rivian, which is expected to provide Amazon with more than 100,000 electric trucks. Some customers argue that "Rivian has a real product and is actually delivering it in production, whereas Lucid does not have full delivery capability at this time. Given Amazon's investment in Rivian, this is hard to ignore."  https://preview.redd.it/ijjgw1ed2rh81.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fa748068c9d08203b157b4ff638902284757d4d  Saudi Arabia announced that it has transferred a 4% stake in Saudi Aramco to the Saudi Public Investment Fund  Saudi Arabia announced that the Saudi government will transfer a 4% stake in Saudi Aramco to the Saudi Arabian Sovereign Wealth Fund (PIF), with a market value of $80 billion.  PIF said the transfer from the government will "strengthen the fund's strong financial position and high credit rating in the medium term," adding that the fund "relies on the value of its assets and the returns on its assets under management to develop its funding strategy."  The deal with Saudi Aramco, which essentially transfers an asset from one pocket of the government to another, is the latest move to boost the fund's assets, which received its first credit rating this month after the fund received billions of dollars from the central bank's reserves and free land for development projects.  After the transfer, the Saudi government remains the largest shareholder in Saudi Aramco, with a 94 percent interest, and PIF's assets under management will increase to help reach its target of more than 4 trillion riyals ($1.07 trillion) in assets by 2025.  https://preview.redd.it/y7z4d41e2rh81.png?width=1078&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e27e15db484218c743d8befa862bf9a4010f6c73  Fed's Daly warns: rate hikes too fast will backfire, should take a "measured" approach  Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that an overly aggressive pace of interest rate hikes would prevent the Fed from reaching its original policy goals.  Daly admitted in an interview, according to economic data, the Fed has to contract quantitative easing measures, but according to past experience, if the Fed's policy shift is too aggressive and brutal, the effect will be counterproductive, will make the pace of economic growth becomes unstable, while endangering the Fed's price stability goals. "The most important thing is to measure with our pace, and more importantly to rely on data," Daly added.  The Fed is gradually reducing asset purchases during the epidemic and is preparing to raise interest rates to fight inflation. The U.S. CPI rose 7.5 percent in January from a year earlier, the fastest rate of growth since 1982.  Market participants expect the Fed to raise interest rates for the first time at its March policy meeting.  Daly's statement implies that she is not in favor of the Fed raising rates by 0.5 percentage points in March, "I'm not in favor of taking action in March, we should look very carefully, measure the future, and then make the next rate increase at what seems like the best time. That could be at the next meeting, or it could be at another meeting."  https://preview.redd.it/upfvvvhe2rh81.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74fd9ed02bc22090a9db6ecf2e3b45092f36b681  U.S. Investors Expect More Volatility Ahead, Along With Market Fears Over Russia-Ukraine Situation  Geopolitical concerns have added another layer of volatility to already volatile markets as investors digest the possibility of an escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, though some suspect the issue will drag down U.S. asset prices in the longer term. Reports of rising tensions between the two countries weighed on stocks on Friday, pushing up the prices of U.S. bonds, the dollar and other safe-haven assets. The Federal Reserve's hawkish stance has already unnerved investors.  President Joseph Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on 12 December after the U.S. government claimed that Russia could "invade" Ukraine "at any time" within days, according to Globes. The two men spoke for about an hour. The media commented that the call did not lead to a breakthrough. Russian officials on the same day accused the U.S. of "hysterically" playing up the alleged Russian "planned invasion" of Ukraine.  Despite market volatility, some investors are skeptical that a more serious conflict will drag down the broader market in the longer term.

Once China's top developer, Evergrande has racked up debts of more than $300 billion and is struggling to repay creditors, suppliers, and investors in wealth management products. Late on Wednesday, Evergrande's executives told creditors in a call it hoped to work with them to achieve a risk management solution, and it would treat all categories of creditors "fairly and follow the international practice."  **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**  [here](https://www.westmoney.com/share/stocknewsdetail?id=945618874898976768&amp;lang=en&amp;color=1&amp;wm=reddit)

Germany is already backpedaling on the SWIFT ban. How do you like the current energy prices? Wait until Biden sanctions India, and see what happens to steel. What‚Äôs happening in EU is going to ripple over into our inflationary environment while Jerome raises rates and causes the economy to tank while we experience supply shortages and port delays. The US isn‚Äôt sanctioning Russia. It‚Äôs sanctioning itself.

If Russia actually annex Ukraine in its territory then China will take the opportunity to do the same to Taiwan and then India will also take the chance and do the same to PoK (Pakistan occupied kashmir) then the Koreans could also get at each others throats. Scarily all these countries have Nukes and it only takes one Nuke launch to have a Domino effect as they will launch it as retaliation then its surely the most disastrous thing to happen to human kind.    Just like how I was wrong about the Russia and Ukraine. I hope this time again it would be wrong.   May peace prevail in our Earth.

176	1	So... the Ukraine and inflation headlines are bullshit.... I've seen this market shrug off some crazy shit over the last 10 years...  Markets always throw a temper tantrum this time of year to bait the fed into delaying tightening.   This time IS a little different in that I've never seen growth stocks get completely cleaned out in a matter of months.. like 50% off the highs and I'm pretty sure wallstreet is gonna short them to pennies.  So if inflation and Ukraine isn't the headline, than what is?  The sectors being bought and sold suggest wallstreet is heavily buying into recession stocks but the heavy concentration into large caps, gold, and oil means they're also targeting the systemic risk stocks.  Wanted to get the communities thoughts. I feel like there's a secret I don't know.

766	1	Hot News  U.S. inflation likely to continue to soar in January, expected to put pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates  Economic data is expected to show that U.S. inflationary pressures continued to heat up early this year, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.  According to the median forecast of surveyed economists, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) may rise 7.3% year-on-year in January, the largest year-on-year increase since the beginning of 1982. The CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food, is expected to rise 5.9 percent. This follows the release of the government's latest non-farm payrolls report, which showed new momentum in the labor market and accelerating payroll growth, sparking market expectations that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls add 467,000 in January, unexpectedly better than expected  Non-farm payrolls posted the largest increase in three months, with the previous values for November and December revised sharply higher by nearly 710,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4%, still close to market expectations and the lowest since the epidemic of 3.9% set in December. The labor force participation rate was the highest since the epidemic. Hourly earnings rose the most in 20 months year-over-year. Expectations of a hawkish Fed rate hike increase.  Pre-US Credit Week: Investors overwhelmed by interest rate anxiety  As credit markets continue to show signs of stress, borrowers will likely continue to look for a stable window to issue new debt next week, while investors remain picky. The Wall Street syndicate sector is expected to issue about $20 billion in new investment-grade debt. Professionals believe the three issuers that chose not to move forward with deals Thursday will revisit them next week as companies deal with volatility swings.  The sell-off in U.S. bonds and related derivatives has been swift and massive so far this year - uncertainty over monetary policy remains high and risk premiums are likely to widen in the coming weeks. Credit market volatility accelerated last week on Thursday after a poor earnings report unnerved investors at Barclays, then peaked on Friday as a stronger-than-expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls report supported the case for a Fed rate hike.  U.S. stock market replay  The three major U.S. stock indices were mixed, with some technology stocks climbing sharply  U.S. stocks closed on Feb. 4, with the Nasdaq up 1.58%, the S&amp;P 500 up 0.52% and the Dow down 0.06%.  U.S. large technology stocks generally strengthened, Amazon, Pinterest, Snapchat and other technology stocks climbed sharply, these companies have announced strong earnings reports.

Steam database shows that in the last 6 months GTA V player count on steam has fallen 33%. FiveM which is a popular roleplaying mod for the game has at this current moment 2/4/22 (11:33 pm EST) 112k players online at the current moment. This popular mod takes away from Rockstar's GTA V Online's player base which takes away TTWO customers and thus results in less profits. Nov 11 Rockstar releases the GTA: The Trilogy which was an extremely buggy, overpriced, horrendous remaster of three of their original games and was not popular among review sites like IGN which gave it a 5/10 or GameSpot which gave it a 4/10. The last time red dead 2 got a real update was 2020. Gta 6 is still in development and is estimated to come out in at least a few years so no time soon. The announcement of GTA 6 being in development this Friday seems like TTWO is just desperate for any sort of boost in stock price so that when earnings comes around the stock price won't drop too far down. Monday on market open I'll be buying puts.

I don‚Äôt think any of this has changed in the last two weeks and of course my dumbass panic sold Boeing calls and barely made anything since. I did but Tesla and Square stock recently.

They belong here with us.
616	1	Vladimir Putin is going to send his forces into Ukraine soon‚Ä¶probably in the next 48 hours.   He‚Äôs burning resources facing certain EU and US sanctions. Germany has a new chancellor for the first time in 16 years and is dependent on their oil via Nord Stream. And Biden isn‚Äôt going to let soldiers die in a new war after a poor withdrawal from Afghanistan and subsequent bad poll numbers.   Putin wants to make Russia bigger and for more people speaking Russian to be in it. What does he have to lose?  The real question is how much is he trying to take? Something small and strategic like Crimea. If not, does he stay east of Kiev? I saw a report that stated the current Russian forces along the border could take the city in 2 days.   Without a counterforce, and there isn‚Äôt one, Putin can easily take Ukraine.   Positions: SPY puts

814	0	Look, I know I shared this two years ago, but it‚Äôs still ageless advice.  Guide to Market Timing  Guide on market trends and timing:  The market knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The federal reserve uses deviations to generate quantitative easing to drive the market from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position that it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is is now the position that it wasn't, and if follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn't.   In the event that the position that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the federal reserve system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference between where the market is and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the QE4. However, the market must also know where it was. The market quantitative easing scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information that the market has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it know where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice versa. And by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called bailouts.

336	0	Today my roommate asked me to proofread his CV. I was like, ‚Äúsure!‚Äù  My roommate, who has been job hunting for a job on Wall Street, is shit at making his CV. It looks like a child made it. I suggested that he use my CV software to make his CV look attractive and professional. I gave him my login so that he didn't have to pay any subscription fee. At the time I thought it was cool of me. Total bro move.   The software made his CV look great. He was more than happy with the outcome. Hedge funds would drool their pants for him. However, before exporting his CV as a PDF document, he wanted me to proofread it first. In fact, he insisted. I didn't mind at all. On the contrary, I encouraged it.   I secretly added a joke to his ‚ÄòHobbies‚Äô section. I figured he‚Äôd laugh before he exported his CV and sent it to any relevant companies.   Apparently he didn‚Äôt check it. He messaged me this afternoon a screenshot of one of the emails he got back. It said his CV was as "unprofessional and grossly inappropriate" and advised him to never contact them again. What did I add to his CV that he *apparently* didn‚Äôt notice??  "Enjoys fucking other people's bitches"   I died laughing when I realized the idiot hadn‚Äôt noticed my change and sent his CV out to probably 5 employers. For reference, he had sex with my ex gf on New Year‚Äôs Eve and later apologized to me. I had told him it was fine, I didn‚Äôt care if they want to hook up. He def got margin called but covered in time.   My roommate seemed sincerely sorry, so I figured it was safe to randomly get back together with my ex. My roommate is super codependent and doesn‚Äôt pay attention to shit at all. He keeps calling and messaging me. Why TF is a grown ass man panicked that I‚Äôm not answering his calls?! It‚Äôs 1 AM bro. Not responding to any of his messages until tomorrow. Sorry he decided to submit his stupid CV without reading it. It is not like I wanted him to feel angry or betrayed. I was just kidding. But the joke worked too well, and I motherfucking succeeded.   So, AITA for making a tiny edit to his CV to test his attention to detail?   $SPY to the moon!

811	0	This will be a downvoted  !!   I was a trader for a long time in a hedge fund.  Even if you understand options well the chance that you will make money in short term trading of stocks and options is very low. Hedge funds  use much more sophisticated methods and relevant infomration (that is not easily accesible) than WSB degens will ever use (even if they learn a lot about options / stocks). Short term trading is their bread and butter and they are the experts in making money doing this. Most likeliy all of you will lose money in trading options and stocks (yes you can be lucky in the short term).  That's the honest truth.  Out of path events like GME last year actually changed that. Yes most of the GME retail buyers are degens that have no idea what they are doing. They don't know options' basics or trading or anything related but still caused a lot of pain for experts. Actually  it's probably because they don't know what they are doing they were successfu in suprising the market.   WSB should be the place for these degens in my opinion.

Its already approved in Europe.   This could be a buy out candidate for a company like PODD that just got approval on their closed loop system.  Large short position. I think people that are short only see the fact that SENS cgm has to be implanted by a Doctor compared to dexcom that can be applied by the user. The convienece may be a much bigger determining factor that they expect.   Are you guys still in this one? I'm up big on all my options but still holding.  Have limits set at 11.

25	1	copyright notice: i do not take ownership of any of these charts or images used in this explanation.   ***in order to explain why bonds are undervalued and an incredible option for a short squeeze play, i need to explain why rates will likely reverse and go lower which ultimately means bonds are undervalued right now because the whole world is shorting them thinking rates will go higher.***  the shorts will likely get squeezed out like they did in 2008 and in 2020, creating a prime opportunity. its also the flight to safety as well so people will likely come rushing in if this thing pops.  in order to do that i need to give you a backdrop on macroeconomics first before i talk about the opportunity being created by wall street/retailers/and the federal reserve shorting and removing liquidity from the bond market.   ***here are the key points discussed in more detail***  1. a broad gdp/cpi/bond yields discussion which shows rates are very likely to reverse and head lower, which has happened many times in recent history since the early 80s. we have seen this same cycle before 2. the us treasury yield curve is inverted, and disagrees with the idea of inflation and the feds.  3. the eurodollar futures curve is very inverted since december and also disagrees with the idea of inflation and the feds 4. the repo market is very illiquid right now and desperately needs treasury securities. tlt is undervalued by historical standpoint right now and it is a good opportunity to buy 5. the us dollar is rallying which invalidates the idea of sustained inflation 6. how the feds and wall street are contributing to the lack of liquidity in treasuries, they are shorting them to oblivion and the feds have been taking them away treasuries with quantitative easing. which decreases liquidity in the repo market because the fed doesn't "buy" treasury securities with money that can be traded as collateral on the repo market. 7. key takeaways... another important thing to note is that bonds are the flight to safety and when they squeeze people from the entire world will flock into them  be warned... this is some heavy shit but its worth it for people to understand this. if you don't wanna read A LOT then skip to the key takeaways at the end.  &amp;#x200B;  1. ***BROAD DISCUSSION***  INFLATION! Bond yields are only going higher right? Cpi prices through the roof. This means high inflation and rates have to go higher right? this is what news stations and the tv will tell you. j powell just went on tv last week and claimed our economy is very strong and he will hike rates to tame "inflation"  ***higher prices don't mean we are in danger of expansion of money, that can only happen if wages are rising fast enough... which they aren't. basically thats a fancy way of saying there is not any risk of actual inflation. (crazy i know)***  Don't believe me?   its as simple as overlaying the cpi onto historic bond yields. if the bond market (possibly the deepest market in the world. approximately 40 trillion dollars deep. with the largest and most sophisticated intelligent investors spread across the entire world with the deepest pockets and largest balance sheets) really thought we were seeing "inflation", bond yields would be waaaay higher than they are now. go look at what yields did in the late 70s. that is TRUE inflation because our broader economy could sustain the higher cpi prices....  bonds haven't cared about the cpi since the 70s. why? because wages haven't kept up with cpi price increases since then.   [this is a few months outdated and cpi prices are actually like twice as high as they are in this graph above. i just needed to give you a relative idea of yields comparatively to show you cpi prices don't affect yields as much as people think](https://preview.redd.it/xyzkwlifgzo81.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b179075e9de56077326820e8c4cd80f9ece11d81)  now we are seeing higher cpi prices, but not a rapid increase of wages to keep up with it..(does this sound familiar? cough 2008) this historically has led to recessions because the higher prices cannot be sustained. hence why they haven't climbed up all the way to 70s and early 80s highs.

It has been going down down down through cpi fluctuations and will continue to go down in spite of what the mainstream media says, and what people on youtube think.

What does the US treasury market think?:***  the treasury yield curve is currently inverted in multiple places as i write this. and will probably get worse in the coming weeks/months. the bond market is calling the feds bluff. as it has successfully done so many times before.

What does the Eurodollar market think?:***  ***Want to know who else is calling the feds bluff that our economy is doing well, and that we will see sustained inflation? EVERYONE... that you probably haven't heard of. (The Eurodollar Market)***  what are eurodollars you may ask? (the fed doesn't want you to know because then people would know the fed doesn't actually control the reserve currency of the entire world)   long story short, "eurodollars" are united states dollars held in offshore bank accounts outside of the jurisdiction of the federal reserve and our government. its offshore lending of us dollars. why is this significant? because the united states dollar is the global reserve currency of the world. meaning if you want to buy oil you need us dollars. if you want pristine collateral (us treasuries) then you need us dollars. (the whole world needs both of them). you can't pay off dollar denominated debts without us dollars.   there is no official data eurodollar lending because there are no laws requiring international banks to publish data on it. hence the nickname "shadow money" or the "ghost ledger".   the euro futures curve has sniffed out every lie the fed has conjured up for the past 20 years. the fed has lost every time! just like the bond market. ***how deep is the eurodollar market?*** ***only about 14 trillion dollars.*** no big deal. (weird how no one has heard of it right?)  https://preview.redd.it/trub3wu2vyo81.png?width=1641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81bc9f105d426ff5267e9c88eab99b04a353528  like the bond market the eurodollars market is one of the deepest and most important markets in the world. and like the bond market... its inverted, and has been since december 2021. and this is no small inversion, this is very serious. ***we are likely already in a recession.*** we will likely experience what china is experiencing right now.   ***What does the agreement between the eurodollar futures curve and the treasury curve mean?***  it takes a huge amount of consensus to move yield curves in a 14 trillion dollar market and a 40 trillion dollar market. so you know when yields are fucked up on both of these curves, we have a big problem that spans far outside the domestic united states.   especially when they are both pointing in the same direction.----&gt; recession  ***4.*** ***What is going on in the repo market?***  what is the repo market you may ask? don't worry. its just a 14 trillion dollar market that allows debt to be extremely liquid so large institutions can trade them overnight to meet debt obligations. its essentially a gage on the health of our worlds financial system. and right now its sick, and has been since 2008  right now behind the scenes in the international banking system there is huge demand for us treasury securities. this means that collateral is short and its essentially a dollar shortage. (not inflation)   i know, you think i'm crazy but its true. look!  [this is just a snapshot, and not the only repo system. But it shows clues that right now treasury securities are making up virtually all of the repo market right now.](https://preview.redd.it/9x72t9ejt0p81.png?width=1673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e9b11a9de7560d933436f518a1e088fd474a5bc)  treasury securities are the bread and butter of the repo market right now, and have been since mortgage backed securities blew it up in 2008. (by the way the yield curve of the bond market and the eurodollar futures curve predicted it)  here's another important clue: tbill yields were recently lower than the guaranteed reverse repo yields from our friends at the federal reserve. why? (i couldnt post the graph here because i ran out of pics sorry)  because there is a utility liquidity premium that entities are willing to pay for the treasury securities.   the repo system has been getting tighter and tighter since 2008, and it may get out of control soon. the problem with repo is essentially what happened in 2008 and 2020. its a fractional reserve system which all kinds of repledging and borrowing of the same security occurs, and there isn't enough to go around for everyone.  &amp;#x200B;  [fed is taking up slack for growing lack of liquidity in repo markets.... and its getting out of control](https://preview.redd.it/d1q0rg53o0p81.png?width=1965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0547a77b805f31a931cef9d8535cdaae6e1d2412)  mortgage backed securities were traded in the repo markets until 2008 when people realized they were garbage and bear sterns and lehman were left holding the bag.   ***So repo markets are strained for treasuries behind the scenes....***  and yet look at TLT!!! no one will buy it because everyone thinks inflation will crush bonds! but history shows that interest rates will reverse. look!

Where is the dollar in this equation?**  a rising dollar shows tight financial conditions and you see a spike in the us dollar price before financial crisis. because foreign (and also domestic) institutions need more dollars to meet debt obligations and they have to go into markets and try and trade different forms of collateral to get them. you cannot pay off us dollar denominated loans with assets other than us dollars.  if we were experiencing inflation then the dollar should not have been rallying since the helicopter stimulus that began in march 2021. more dollars = weaker dollar right? ***why is the dxy rallying? this completely invalidates the entire idea of inflation***  [where's the inflation from qe that began in 2008? ill give you a hint. it doesn't exist.](https://preview.redd.it/zem29843yyo81.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b3cf4c5a8a928857421353cbaa1e8af79a726a8)  https://preview.redd.it/s8afd2tpyyo81.png?width=3837&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76590160e90fa8c925649dd95fc202d4798782ff  ***6.

[this just about sums it up... bond yields on the long end of the curve and the eurodollar libor rates don't care about the feds rate hikes... the feds only influence the short end of the curve as you can see from the longer yield trend charts i posted here in my earlier discussions. the charts don't lie... but politicians sure do ](https://preview.redd.it/ibqqjrndezo81.png?width=1289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=579707210d2390518ca81f12bb41be001aaac615)  here's a history of the federal funds rate hikes starting way back in early 70s before inflation really took off in 78. read it and notice how it didn't work... they were hiking rates far more than they are now all the way through the 70s and inflation still ensued..

"money" in and of itself is becoming increasingly more difficult to define  can you use laundromat tokens to buy groceries at the store? both could be considered some form of "money".  it sounds stupid but it is essentially the same concept as what we will go over here.. it is not as simple as the federal reserve buys treasuries with "cash",   ***here's a basic explanation of why qe is not inflationary. (i know everyone believes it is, but people will eventually catch on because it didn't work in japan and it doesn't work now)***  ***The short answer is basically that banks lending (true inflation in our fractional reserve system) is affected by the amount of DEPOSITS they have. not the amount of RESERVES they have. meaning when the fed increased the amount of reserves banks have in exchange for their treasury securities, it doesn't spur lending growth which is not inflationary.***  ***it doesn't matter if the fed can "print" these reserves for the banks when they "buy" treasury securities. the net effect is that it doesn't create bank behavior that spurs inflation...***  [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quhkjLAXFGs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quhkjLAXFGs)  the federal reserve act of 1937 which allowed the feds to do "open market operations" was designed to stop the feds from being able to create inflation because of the inflation problems in europe that ensued after world war 1. if the feds could create inflation, i can assure you we would already be fucked with hyperinflation.   still not convinced? then ask yourself this question.  ***If quantitative easing is so inflationary as people on youtube claim and as textbooks will tell you, (i just read it out of a very nice book i picked up a little while back) then why didn't it work in japan? they are on QE#27... no such inflation? they started in 2001. everyone knows its in deflation.***   &amp;#x200B;  [diminishing effects.... because the reactions are based off of psychology... people in america haven't caught on yet...](https://preview.redd.it/5abuckhu12p81.png?width=2435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1993af71b2e05d7866c156c57f6922a3bca6747e)  [how is this any different from whats happening now? lol ](https://preview.redd.it/pqhwzbt612p81.png?width=1583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f31d3abdfb57adeddc2360cebbd6aace39f8dca3)  why would it be any different here? can you point out a technical mechanical reason why their qe would be different than ours and prove it to me? we've already been through this in japan.... it doesn't work....   this is why the velocity of money has been crushed since qe began in the united states. because all of these "dollars" are trapped on the balance sheets of the banks.... they cannot use them in repo transactions and they cannot escape into the economy.

No one thought Russia would use and express such rationale. Facing all the sanctions, Russias response is it is illegal. And they will push on. They threatened Finland and Sweden, neutral countries, if they moved closer to NATO. Both countries today did. Russia is alone, even China tells them to step down. NATO is far superior to Russia, it is like a grown man vs a toddler. But, the toddler has nuclear weapons.Putin is cornered. He acts irrational. He might attack the Baltics (NATO members) or Finland, Sweden. Both will trigger NATO.

11	1	   First off, congrats to everyone that made bank from that price action this week. It has been a refreshing change from all of the loss porn. Even though my tits remain jacked for the rest of the week and the short term momentum, I want to discuss my thoughts on GME, why it is a great LONG play based on fundamentals, and why I think it will be the next TSLA.  First, these two companies have some essential similarities for my comparison  1. They have a huge retail following and remarkably loyal/enthusiastic investor base 2. Charismatic, passionate, and incredibly successful leaders in Cohen and Elon 3. The companies are developing new tech to be leaders in a mostly untapped market  My comparison on the fundamental side will focus on current day GME as compared to TSLA in 2017.  ........................................TSLA (2017).......... GME (today)  Market cap............................71b........................10b  Share Price.............................70...........................141  Revenue................................11b..........................6.1b  EPS.......................................-2.37......................... -5.25  Current Assets.....................6.5b.........................2.6b  Current Liabilities.................7.6b........................1.3b  Long term debt....................11.6b......................40m (yes, million)  So, looking at these numbers they are not perfect, but I think the same thing ultimately held TSLA back that will hold GME back from a fundamental perspective. This being EPS. Both companies proving to grow revenue, but not turning profit or creating cash flow. From a balance sheet perspective, GME is actually quite a bit better here with 2:1 assets:liabilities and essentially no long term debt. The cash burn for GME is a result of their investment into new streams of revenue and will hopefully start to show improvement in regard to EPS with the marketplace launch. This same lack of cash flow generation held back TSLA for years, but they did eventually turn positive in 2020 and guess what happened to the share price? Yep, rocket emojis.  Tesla share price went from 130 in Jan, 2020 to 793 in Jan, 2021 (adjusted price for splits)  I think long term, if you believe in the marketplace as a good move for the business of GME (as I do), we could see similar price action with institutional adoption and closed short positions over time.  A couple of other things GME has working in their favor:  1. Insiders really believe. Insider buys 104k shares the last 2 days, sells 743 shares (form 4 filing) 2. Shrinking float. 76m shares - 13.6m(18% insiders) - 21.3m(28% institutions) - 10m (DRS) = **31.1m**  TLDR: GME is the next TSLA (in terms of stock performance). Once the marketplace starts to generate revenue and EPS turns positive we will see a TSLA-style run.  Disclosure: 343 shares at 153 average  I like the stock

628	0	[ouch](https://imgur.com/a/t5fvdAY)  Probably the worst few days of my life. Decided to get all emotional after seeing my  portfolio down 20% after buying the bull trap a couple weeks ago, and got into high risk leverage trading after a friend told me about his gains from it. What's even worse is I've NEVER leverage traded before this, and was looking up guides on youtube on where and how to start. I THOUGHT that I would be fine since I know how to read support and resistance on a chart... but clearly my risk management was so awful that even if I was right, a slight change of events could cause a HUGE loss or even liquidation. Literally the first ever trade i put in $40k thinking "oh, this is free money" and then BOOM liquidated (didn't even place a stop loss). After that happened I just dug myself in a deeper and deeper hole... at one point I was up $30k but as I kept putting more money in attempting to cover my portfolio loss and also that first liquidation event, things got so bad that all my coinbase holdings were WIPED. So look... i know most people aren't this stupid, but if you get into this game thinking about just trying to make a quick buck, unless you manage your risk everything will get thrown in the bin. That's what I've learned, even though it's so trivial you sometimes have to take a huge loss to understand. Luckily for me, I still have funds to work with and do what im best at, NFT's, which has made me most of my money to begin with.
233	0	Each time oil has spiked as much as it has lately it has started a recession. Think of it this way, prices are way up right? Well no one is magically making a lot more money, therefore their cost basis is still the same, but they can‚Äôt afford as much as they used too. Paying more for rent, food, utilities, all the necessities in todays world. What does that cause? People spending more of their income on necessities means they can‚Äôt spend as much on wants and desires, like; iPhones, eating out, new tvs, maybe even affording a child, etc. you get the point.   What does that cause? A slow down in the economy which we‚Äôre already seeing, companies earnings aren‚Äôt coming back as hot as they were a year ago off the pandemic.   What‚Äôs even worse? The FED has to hike rates to tame inflation in an already slowing economy. It would be like introducing someone who‚Äôs already sick, to another illness that will affect them even more, hurting their recovery. It may even get worse, it likely is.   Lastly, the US imposed $$$ sanctions on Russia. At face value it may not seem like much, but this potentially worsens things far greater than anything I‚Äôve mentioned. Why?   Russia is moving away from dependency/trade/any use of the dollar. This means more dollars will be put into the economy from a country who yields 1.5 trillion a year in revenue I believe. Next? This will likely cause China to look for alternatives to the dollar. Potentially gold or another currency. Many economists believe a virtual currency will take its place, its unknown, but likely.   What does this mean for the US overtime? WE ARE SCREWED! Inflation will likely get worse for years to come if this comes to pass sooner rather than later. Russia is going to sell off its U.S. treasuries/dollars as soon as possible to become independent. China is likely going to collude with Russia on this one, they‚Äôve been pretty quiet in this whole mess.  We could potentially be entering a war of monetary policy, the internet and a trade war.   The yield curve hasn‚Äôt flattened yet, many other metrics aren‚Äôt pointing to a recession just yet, but who‚Äôs to say we can‚Äôt enter a recession prior to all of this coming to pass. The markets price things in, in the future. Not so much at the present.   What can we do? Spend frugally and prepare for the worst. Cash is likely going to become worthless over the next decade, so we have to find safe areas to invest our money. I‚Äôm studying and watching things. I‚Äôm young so I hope I can just make a decent call moving forward, so we don‚Äôt lose all purchasing power.   Oof, what do you think?

242	0	Not sure how to start this off but I think this is about a good time to buy Rivian, perhaps a once in a life time opportunity.   You may take a look at the stock price and see it dropping and think not to invest, but we have to look into why it is dropping.   Amazon, the largest investor in Rivian, has a contract for 100,000 or so delivery vans from Rivian by 2025. Just recently, Amazon decided to get delivery vans from Stellantis. Investors hear this and think that Amazon is ditching Rivian, when in reality, Amazon did not sell their Rivian stock, nor have they cancelled the contract. They are simply getting electric vans from multiple companies, decreasing the risk that one company will not be able to fulfill the ev van contract. However, investors have panic sold regardless because that's what investors tend to do.   Here's why I think Rivian will go back up.  Eventually people will realize that everything is fine and that the huge sell off was over nothing. Also, people will most likely be buying the dip. The most important reason perhaps is that Rivian has barely delivered any of its vehicles to customers yet as they have just started fulfilling orders. Based on reviews from influencers and people who have gotten their trucks, they are very good trucks. These are the perfect conditions for Rivian to take off because as Rivian delivers more trucks, they will definitely get a lot of positive attention from customers and a lot of people will be talking about the trucks.  Now for the position itself. I am DCAing for a month. You may want to DCA over a shorter period of time if you think it will reverse sooner, or you may want to DCA longer if you think it will take a bit to really turn around. IDK what I'm doing, so I am just buying shares every day for a month.   &amp;#x200B;  TLDR:  People are panic selling Rivian over nothing and as soon as Rivian delivers more of their trucks, which people seem to love, they will get lots of positive attention, and people will buy back in. I recommend DCAing as it is impossible to time the bottom of the dip, but I think the dip is near.

Its a beautiful quarter point raise, Jpow hinted that the rest will be quarter points as well and the market loves it.  2. Ukraine conflict has been fully priced in. Putin‚Äôs midlife crisis has hopefully come to a head and the sanctions being imposed have definitely shook him and his boys up. Its also made China realize the cost of doing war in a fully globalized economy. Barring any major escalations from Putin, the market will continue its uptrend.  3. The global economy is sizzling hot. Metrics from almost every sector are putting up great numbers, unemployment is at all time lows, we are seeing the final exit from the covid economy. The last lagging effect is supply chain issues. Which brings us nicely to my next point.  4. Inflation is actually transitory and not as bad as the numbers suggest. Most of the inflation we‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt because of all the money we printed. Its because of heavy demand coupled with supply side hiccups and hangovers from covid. Its known as cost push inflation. So all the urchins out there trying to peddle some crap about hyperinflation and weimar republic are just abusing your pea brain for clicks. However inflation will most likely remain high for some time while the fed reigns it in. So if inflation persists but the economy is hot‚Ä¶. What should you do with your money?  5. Buy the dip ******. Stop trying to be fancy with grandma‚Äôs death money or your shitty kid‚Äôs community college fund. I don‚Äôt know where you retards are getting some of these awful plays that I see in the loss porn. Maybe TikTok? Treat yourself to some tasty SPY calls, or if you‚Äôre feeling frisky, TSLA calls. Everything is pricey right now due to all the volatility, but calls are cheap relatively and in my opinion dirt cheap if you believe that the market is moving up hard. Pretty much everything is going to rip and soon. I‚Äôm already up roughly 200k on my positions but they‚Äôve got plenty or room to run. This week was most likely the bottom and beginning of the rip, but you haven‚Äôt missed out.  My final speculation is that not only are we going to see green, but the market will retrace back up to our previous ATHs scarily fast.   TL;DR Monday was the bottom, buy the dip       [positions](https://i.imgur.com/mpQcgoe_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)
916	1	Germanies woes are building up like a finacial armaggedon, as Deutche bank and Commerz bank absorb billions in commercial loan losses, and the weapons of mass destruction that Deutche bank has, become due on the back of inflation and 3rd party risk, while the Ukraine and energy crises rages,...  It's all a formula for economic disaster, as Angela Merkel said, if we lose the Auto industry were done.  Not to mention the 250 ELECTRIC VEHICLE MAKERS ALL DECENDING AND AT WAR WITH GERMANYS CAR MAKING BUSINES...S  GERMANY FACES THREATS OF SANCTINS FROM USA FROM TRADING WITH RUSSIA... AND ECONOMIC LOSS IF RUSSIA GOES TO WAR...because Russia is a big trading partner of Germany...  Much of the cars they sell go to China...the USA IS WRECKING GERMAN BUSINESS, THEREFORE GERMANY COULD TURN EAST CAUSING THE WEST TO DUMP SHARES...  THE RETOOLING FROM COMBUSTION ENGINES TO EVs also is a loss if you lose market share to 250 plus new EV companies all taking market share like tesla...  The collapse of DEUTCHE BANK alone could not only down Germany but even the world...
698	0	I keep seeing posts here about this CPI stock that went up 7% today and JPOW keeps pumping up. Don't roast me but I still use Robinhood. For some reason they don't have the CPI stock. Am I doing something wrong or do they just not have the stock on Robinhood? Thanks in advance!
444	1	"because Russia"    Yes     However, specifically, this morning, when many stonks we have been trading were down 15%, 25%, 50% **pre-market,** who was it that decided that the market reaction needed to be **so drastic.**     Financial markets react to global situations, of course.      ***Was the reaction we saw pre-market a reasonable reaction to this particular global situation?***      &amp;#x200B;  Who decided that all the prices would be so drastically low this morning?   (**Specifically, pre-market pricing)**     a) hedge funds and market makers   b) retail traders selling out of fear   c) foreign actors placing small retail orders; triggering the algos, retail traders, hedgies, and market makers for the sell-off?     This is a genuine question.   And not an unreasonable one.      "because Russia"    OK sure   *but then what happened?*   Step-By-Step   ELI5
594	0	You wonder why ur puts are getting destroyed everytime inflation is hotter than expected? Because the market is finally realizing that the FED is absolutely retarded and they wont increase rates at the pace of inflation.   Inflation for stocks is good. Well, in nominal value. But it goes up! So as inflation is hotter than expected, people are finally realizing that selling stocks for a currency that only devalues is very fucking retarded.   The FED is scared of raising rates because they fear that the economy will fucking crumble like Venezuela. Biden and Congress want to throw money into the economy like its Christmas morning and GDP per capita in present and future value is absurd.   NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE  Why should you buy calls? Because inflation in the long run will thrive, and interest rates will be lower as the market will adjust itself and Powell wants that nice nominal economy.   Why should you listen to me? Because im from Argentina. A country that throws money to poor people and middle class like they are the kings of england. Our inflation is fucking ripping and rates are increasing. But who the fuck wants to save money in a dead economy? Thats why if you check the stock market in USD, its fucking dead. But if you check in nominal value, record each fucking day. Doesnt matter how bad the economy gets, ALWAYS GOES FUCKING UP.
67	0	Right now Peleton is allowing everyone to do a free trial for up to 100 days. If all the retards in this sub took them up on the free trial, we would generate $17.6B in sales for PTON that would be reflected in the next quarterly report, driving the stonk up bigly. After 99 days the stock will go to $69,420 so all the otm calls that we buy tomorrow will make us all super rich. After that 99 days we will all return our bikes right after we all buy puts on PTON. The next quarter they will have to admit to the hedgies that got short squeezed that those sales were not only fake, but they actually went bankrupt because the cost to ship, assemble, give 99 days of free classes, rebox and ship back 11.7M bikes was too much. We play both sides and become richer than Musk. This literally can't go tits up.   Disclosure: long PTON and need a wsb bailout after losing my kids college savings. Need to turn 50¬¢ into $50B in 100 days. Easy $. This is financial advice contingent on everyone in this sub ordering a peleton bike.

393	1	 The Russian rouble tumbled to a record low against the dollar on Monday, after Western nations announced a harsh set of sanctions over the weekend to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including curbs on the country's currency reserves.  The rouble fell as far as 119.50 per dollar in Asian trading, a record low for the currency and a steep drop of 30% from Friday's close. It subsequently recovered to around 110 per dollar.  Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear-armed forces on high alert on Sunday, in response to Western reprisals for his war on Ukraine - the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.  Russia's central bank (CBR) announced a slew of measures on Sunday to support domestic markets, as it scrambled to manage the fallout of the sanctions that will block some banks from the SWIFT international payments system.  The central bank said it would resume buying gold on the domestic market, launch a repurchase auction with no limits and ease restrictions on banks' open foreign currency positions.  The currency had found some support last week from the first Russian central bank currency interventions since 2014 when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine.  Analysts at Rabobank said the sanctions on currency reserves removed what little support the rouble had.  "Even the gold is not liquid if nobody can use FX in exchange for it. There will be a complete collapse in the rouble today..." they wrote.  Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, said in a note on Sunday, "a collapse in the rouble appears inevitable on Monday morning", and there was an increased risk of a Russian debt default as a result of the weekend developments.  "For the rouble whilst you might see it should sell off somewhat, I really doubt you are going to see people put on fresh bets to sell the rouble at these levels ‚Äì so you might well see it weakening, but I don‚Äôt think you will see people transacting all that heavily," said Peter Kinsella, London-based global head of FX strategy at UBP.  "There is a general lack of liquidity, and where you do see liquidity it is one-sided, skewed to rouble sellers. It will be tricky, I can see rouble weakening quite severely ‚Äì but just because it is weakening doesn‚Äôt mean it will be transacting heavily."

154	0	Hey guys so I‚Äôm seeing there‚Äôs a lot of shorts right now in Sofi technologies and I wanted to ask if you think if it‚Äôs a good squeeze opportunity for us or if I should be bearish too? Sofi it‚Äôs at 8.59 $from the 23$ 52week high. I wanted to know your thoughts In it guys should We go bullish looking for the squeeze or should we go bearish too?
673	1	The title should be enough to explain what I am trying to convey.  Yes, there may be reasons for a stock's decline. So if its declining, we should inspect with care for the reason, but the market is irrational and so are you guys, you guys lose your mind (most, not all) and immediately turn your opinion about the stock when it starts on a tear.  I remember seeing all those bear posts in 2019 about Alphabet. It declined a bit and you all were trashing it saying it is a shit company (not just a shit stock). "I use adblocker and use all those Google services for free, everyone I know is doing the same. I don't know how they will even make money.", "Google is irrelevant, they haven‚Äôt innovated a single product worth using", " I stopped using Google search".  The same narrative was prevalent about AMD a few years ago and is currently prevalent about INTC.  Even though, I have no position in GME and think that most of the GME retards will lose money (I played GME around 2020 and January 2021, and after that I exited my positions), I still see the same thing about GME for example. Whenever the stock jumps, everyone suddenly becomes more bullish and when the stock dives, everyone suddenly becomes pessimistic, when the opposite should have happened (though I think anyone holding GME at this valuation is most likely an actual retard based on balance of probability).  Currently, I see a similar sentiment around companies like Meta, Paypal for example.  The same goes for Nvidia. Even though I think that Nvidia valuation is a little insane (Nvidia cannot produce 3 times more FCF than INTC in the long run, that's what I think), whenever it dives, you guys say, "No one can even buy their product, shit company", when it jumps, "No one can even buy their product, mega bullish".  The only exception is probs Apple and Tesla.   **Why did I write such a long rant?**  I finally understood the 2 main reasons why 90% retail traders lose money. 1. They make bad plays. Mr Captain Obvious. 2. They become fearful when they should be greedy...  So, TL;DR: if you actually think something is good, buy when it‚Äôs mega down and sell only when you think you have an absolutely amazing play (don't just sell out of winners to chase something you are not even sure of, because most gains come from a handful of right plays).
417	1	Citi Analyst slammed PLTR for investing in SPACs because he said they are driving revenues. In reality only 3% of PLTRs $1.5bln in 2021 revenues was from SPAC clients. They have grown commercial (non-gov) clients from 49 to 147 over the year, and only 20 are clients that have used SPACs. Commercial revenues are up 79% in Q4 from last year even Excluding SPACs.

If any of these interest you, then you might be interested in what we're building. We're making a group investing platform where you can easily form investment groups with friends or strangers and begin investing, risk-free. Additionally, there will be reddit-like community features so you can discuss and get investment ideas from others and make an investment on the spot, along with features from more traditional investment apps that you all know and love.   You can sign up for our waitlist on our [website](https://group-invest.webflow.io/) \- the first 10,000 signups to our platform will get 1 year of premium for free, so do act fast if you are interested.

Inflation is a problem, and it‚Äôs one that we need to address, but I don‚Äôt expect a recession in the United States,‚Äù the Treasury secretary said.  Yellen also said she believed that the Federal Reserve could achieve a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù for the economy -- taming inflation without triggering a recession.

510	0	Title says it all.  When I buy contracts, I need to let them expire for a 100% loss.   I ONLY buy on expiration. I then sit there and watch my premium decay into nothing by 4:00 PM.

Green feels good, but red always feels right. I just feel accomplished on a Friday night knowing I pissed away thousands of dollars- it makes for a great bar conversation.

At least tomorrow I can save more money to buy options on Friday.

The white dotted line is the 50 SMA, that has been acting as a resistance today.   A move lower this week could offer another good entry point hopefully for a longer bull run.

If you think for one second the US military is going to put their plans on the fucking news, you‚Äôre retarded. If you think you can trust what Putin says, you‚Äôre retarded. If you think you saw it on the news, Reddit or YouTube before real money had a 15-30 min window to react, you are retarded. Just wait until something happens to start talking about it or accept the fact that our bearish trend is just a normal reaction to the fact that our inflation is fucking out of control and we have a major supply chain and labor issues and planned rate hikes. Big money is extracting with huge gains while you retards lube up your hands to hold some fucking bags. Russia is the cherry on top.

482	1	About 60% of our energy generation comes from fossil fuels - coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other gases. About 20% comes from nuclear energy, and about 20% comes from renewable energy sources like wind, hydropower and solar. Natural gas is used in steam turbines and gas turbines to generate electricity and stored in city electrical grids using generator stations, transmission lines and towers, and individual consumer distribution lines that feed to your precious tesla superchargers. There are a plethora of things that use crude oil. Asphalt for one uses the left over components of crude oil to pave the roads we drive on.  Tires are another thing that need oil. There are two types of rubber used in manufacturing tires ‚Äì natural and synthetic. Natural rubber is derived from the rubber tree.¬† The ‚Äúsap‚Äù or latex is harvested and refined to produce natural rubber tires. Once that runs out we use synthetic rubber tires which is manmade from petrochemical feedstocks which crude oil is the primary raw material. It roughly takes approximately seven gallons of oil to produce a single tire and approximately 5 billion gallons of crude oil are used to make tires each year. Five gallons used as feedstock (from which the substances that combine to form synthetic rubber are derived), while two gallons supply the energy necessary for the manufacturing process.  Also on a side note the amount of copper needed in tesla battery packs are huge. Which is all mined from the earth's crust that need heavy diesel polluting machinery to mine. Water quality from copper sulfide mines also severely impact the drinking water aquifers, contribute to contamination of farmland, and contamination and loss of fish, wildlife and their habitats, seriously harming public health. Took a tangent but yeah rant over.

768	1	Hey guys. Im the type of person who likes to analyze things and figure out the most efficient way to go about stuff. I love doing TA and solid entry everyday.   Been thinking alot lately about what ive been doing trade wise and why ive not been as successful as i should be. And really its come down to greedy for me. Alot of you probably read my post over the weekend about not being greedy and how one successful trade a day is all you need.   I had given a scenario where you could 6x you portfolio in 6 weeks. But that involved risking the whole lot the whole time and that's not smart nor realistic. So it got me thinking... how can i be efficient at this, while successful and minimizing big losses. And this is what i have come up with and what i will be doing starting monday (assuming my funds from fidelity make it to my bank so i can deposit in TOS and they get the options approved. If not we start Tuesday).   I am calling this the 10% challenge. This challenge will look different for everyone depending on 1. Your risk tolerance 2. You starting capital and 3. How confident you are in your options ability.   Now this will only work if you are dedicated and consistent. You have to be disciplined in your entry. This is not a FOMO type of trading strategy at all. You have to look for the right entry and the right exit. If your trade stalls out at 7% tou take profits before its -10%!. Profits are king here. Stop losses will be a must if you let these ride which is what i plan to do.   So heres the strategy and then i will show the math.   Every week we start fresh. So for me this week im starting with 5k and once i get some funds moved and settled next week will start with 10k. Exact 10k in your account.  My plan is come friday with whatever profits above 10k i have they will be moved to a separate account and invested in shares of vti.   So its Monday morning and we have a fresh 10k in our accounts (a fresh 10k we can afford to lose... we never invest what we cant afford to lose).   What's the plan? Its simple. We are making ONE trade today. ONE good solid trade today that will net us positive gains. How are we going to do that. We are going to use support and resistance along with MOMENTUM. We always trade WITH the momentum NEVER against it. (This post isnt a focus on how to trade options but rather the strategy i can make a separate post on my how to if people want...).   Okay so we are watching the charts and we have found the good entry. A good entry we know and feel confident in. It goes with the momentum and its NOT right before a new 30 minute candle opens. We will utilize 3-7 dte for these trades for the quickest return. Note- there is high risk if your entry is wrong. If you are still struggling with entries consider doing 14-30 dte. We will also be utilizing the next otm strike (whether thats up or down).   Now this is the part that EVERYONE including me is going to really struggle with... we are taking profits at 10%. No matter what. We do not let this trade go red.  This is how i plan to approach this. I will watch my trade as soon as i enter it. If you has a solid entry and good momentum within seconds maybe even minutes you should be at 10-20% up.   We made a good entry, we are up lets say 10% now. Whats next? We set a stop loss for breakeven. This important! We do not want to see red. We need green or even. We could consider a 5% stop loss here but 5% is tight for options...   Okay lets say we had a great entry, SPY is on a run, we timed it just how we needed to and we are up 20% within seconds or minute's... we take profits right? Maybe...   We have 2 things we can do here. 1. We can take profits at 20% and be happy with a killer trade. Or 2. We can set a stop loss for 10% or even 15%. For me if the momentum has stopped and im above 20% im taking profits. If its still running i will do 10% stop and move it up by 5% every 5%. So 25%=15%, 30%=20% etc.   Okay so we made our one trade of the day. We took profits at 10% like a boss. Now what? Not a damn thing. Go enjoy the rest of your day.   If everything went right and we followed the 10% rule. Our 10k should have netted 1k profits (i will use round numbers here for the ease of math and reading).   Okay Tuesday comes our account now has a beautiful 11k in it. What do we do? Same thing. We make ONE GOOD well thought out MOMENTUM trade following the above method.   So Tuesday we end with $12,100.   Wednesday comes we use our $12,100 and make ONE GOOD MOMENTUM trade for 10%... now we have $13,310.   Thursday our $13,310 becomes $14,640 at the end of the day...   Friday our $14,640 becomes $16,105.  Congrats you just made 5 easy trades and turned your 10,000 investment into $16,105. You just make $6000 in one week... crazy right?   NOW this is the important part. We take those 6k in profits and we move into into safer investment like shares of VTI in another account we cant touch. We re-invest our earned money so it continues to work with us. Dont reinvest this is a high risk thing.   And we start the next monday over with a fresh 10k...   Now there will be people who say how are you going to perfectly make 5 trades in a row every week without being wrong. Its simple. We are trading momentum. We are trading the trend. We arent guessing. We know when we invest our money and we open our position that its going to go the way we want. We arent concerned at all. And for anyone whos done options for even one day know SPY is volatile yet stable enough to do this. If SPY moves 0.2% thats easily 20-30% gains sometimes. SPY does not need to move much to do this and be successful. The thing about this is we dont have to be perfect... we dont have to be 100% gains right. We have to be right about the momentum. If you cant enter and exit a trade and net 5-10% gains everytime you need to stop what you are doing and find a better method to find entries.   Okay so some of us still struggle with entries... but i feel most of us easily could get 5% gains every entry.... your 10k using the method above would be at $12,760 at the end of the week. Thats alot of money for barely moving...   Heres a fun break down (note- this is just doing easy math 5 trades a week for 52 weeks... i know markets not open every monday to Friday but this is just for easy numbers).  -10k @ 5 trades with 20% take profit= $24,800 on friday... or $770k in one year. -10k @ 5 trades with 15% profit= $20,113 or $525k one year. -10k @ 5 trades 10%= $16,105 or $317k/ year -10k @ 5 trades 5%= $12,762 or 143k/ year   Now i understand 10k is alot for some people so lets do 5k and 1k for the same thing...   -5k @ 5 trades 20%= $12,400 or $385k/ year -5k @ 5 trades 15%= $10,100 or $266k -5k @ 5 trades 10%= $8,100 or $161k -5k @ 5 trades 5%= $6,700 or $89k   -1k @ 5 trades 20%= 78k -1k @ 5 trades 15%= $52k -1k @ 5 trades 10%= $31.2k -1k @ 5 trades 5%= $15.6k   As you can see there is some absolutely incredible gains to be made when we simplify things. Ive never seen anyone break it down like this and had someone broken it down like this i would never have held the positions ive had while up or made silly yolo trades. Options is a risk. But when we simplify things we can win at this game.   You have to remove your emotions. We are here for gains and to win and to trade again the next day. I never wanna see anyone post another -99% or another loss porn. I wanna see the accounts that have 15x at the end of the year... cause thats what this strategy allows...   No ones perfect and we will have bad days. When you have a bad day we stop. We Re-evaluate and try again. If we have a 2nd one maybe we consider paper trading for a bit. Dont get greedy.

267	1	 The hedge fund and crossover VC investor Tiger Global is now down 23% YTD in 2022.  In the most recent years, traditional hedge fund Tiger started to act more as a VC firm, often funding very early stage private software companies with massive valuations. Their funding model closely resembled that of SoftBank's. The idea here was to fund as many companies as fast as possible, and essentially build an index of early stage investments. Even if 9/10 of these go wrong, as long as there is one massive exit through an acquisition or IPO, they would return enormous amounts of capital to their investors.  This funding model worked phenomenally in 2020 and 2021, as many private companies found their exits. Also, private company valuations kept jumping up at each level one after another. It got to a point where just a team with an idea and no product could show up in front of Tiger and get valued at over $10M for their seed round, with no due diligence done from their side. At peak, Tiger was doing more than one deal a day - meaning there was no way they were actually looking into the product/tech/prospects of the company.  So far, even though public market valuations have dropped drastically in 2022, private company valuations have held their relative strength. But now that crossover funds such as Tiger have become increasingly popular, we can expect to see more correlation between these two markets. This is being reflected now, as Tiger is reportedly slowing down on their early stage VC investments. Either they recognize that the party has ended and you can no longer value companies at millions just based on an idea, or it could be as simple as they believe that the public market offers better opportunities for now.  Either way, we are bound to see a spillover of some of the carnage from public markets in privates.   Btw, if anyone here works at Tiger Global, would love to see some loss porn.
370	1	Futures are plunging into red again and after market is seeing flurry of dumps.  The PUMDUM signal is the ratio of PUMP to DUMP. If more DUMP than PUMP then PUMP your calls by the ratio. If more PUMP than DUMP then DUMP your puts by schrodingers equation.  This trading strategy has never failed in the last 20 years! It has never succeeded either but I can feel it in my bones tomorrow it will   Futures dumping, market pumping. Whose money? Fuck knows.
915	1	A big green day for stock market! Nasdaq went up more than 3.10%! As I mentioned, If Big caps want to jump very fast, Index will get in all time high very soon! Big Caps in Tech should go up very slowly and let small caps to grow. Because small caps can‚Äôt move the index up very fast!  Just be careful! Let the market go up slow but incessant!

Seriously is there anyone in Theta gang who is actually having a good time? Puts are a bad idea, covered calls are just a bandaid on a fking missing limb.

The video included the man singing the song will banging on bongos, headbanging EDM cat, screaming cowboy, and Janet Yellen dancing in a shower of cash. Do me a solid and resurrect that thread/video for me. Thanks!

559	0	I don't think y'all understand that covered calls are exactly the same as cash secured puts. If a stock's going down, would you sell puts? Shit, you dumbasses probably would. I bet you feel like Warren Buffet, selling calls against shares of shitty meme stocks. Like w*ow, you're earning premiums smaller than your micropenis.* BUT YOU STILL LOSE MONEY IF THE STOCK GOES DOWN.  Seeing how retarded everyone is, those of you with even a single functioning brain cell have thought of inversing WSB. But HOLY SHIT, you guys can't even inverse yourselves properly. When you see a few retards buy calls, you yolo your entire fucking account on puts. Then the next day, everyone's calls are worthless, but so are your puts. Because the stock stayed fucking FLAT. Yeah, bet you didn't realize that was possible. Meanwhile thetagang is wondering how millions of years of evolution failed to raise the average IQ above 40. Do you understand how fucking stupid you are? The opposite of buying calls is *selling calls.*  You wanna stop losing money? I wish I could help, I really do, but it's impossible. I've been hard at work in my lab, trying to find a solution, but I can't fix stupid. You will always be stupid, even after the heat death of the fucking universe. Fuck you. You're a loser and nobody likes you. You're stupid and retarded and fat and ugly. Your parents wish they aborted you. I hate you specifically with a fucking passion.  &amp;#x200B;  Positions: puts on WSB. I'm 100% serious. Currently calling my broker to unlock options
842	1	Ok. So this is the FB bull post among all the bear posts.  1. FB has Instagram. Yes. That thing you use daily. It‚Äôs owned by FB. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you quit using FB and start using Instagram. They will still get your eyeball and that's dollar.  2. FB has WhatsApp. Which is slowly creating monetization opportunities in developing countries. It could a be bigger cash cow than Instagram even.  3. FB based Marketplace and Meta's continuous integration of similar selling services will ultimately be the biggest cash cow of FB.  4. Stonks go down, stonks will go up. We can buy the dip.  5. FB has much, much better fundamentals than the overall market. TTM P/E is much lower compared to S&amp;P 500 index (though P/E doesn‚Äôt mean jackshit).  Indebtedness much lower, growth gonna be higher in the long run, and the most important thing: FCF is much better compared to the overall market.  Now, tell me this. We can gamble on SPY call options, buy VOO. Yet, we cannot do that for FB? Buy FB stonks?  Don‚Äôt give me that look. Don't tell me it‚Äôs morally bankrupt or some shit. Every company in the index is the same. Weapons manufacturers, oil giants, banks,  real estate speculator companies, those soft drinks companies etc. Which one is not harming society?  Moreover, when such a giant drops 20%+ in a single day, you know it‚Äôs a knee-jerk reaction from the market, you know it will be back up pretty soon as long as the overall market doesn‚Äôt crush.

878	0	After hours trading closed with Facebook trading just shy of 250 dollars per share.   A stunning move that occurred within minutes of the earnings miss and lower guidance from Meta.  Was this warranted or just another example of sell first ask questions later mentality.  Let us examine P/E.  On close Meta‚Äôs P/E was at 23.  This PE after being  cut down in  recent weeks was  at levels we saw for tech mid 2019.  We ended after hours trading just shy of 250 with a PE ratio of about 16.6.   To put things in perspective 16.6 was where the energy sector was trading June of 2019 during early pandemic days.  If we were to wind the clock back this also takes us back to 2010, 2022 levels for the tech sector.  Meta is a company at the top of its segment with a 50B cash pile making incredible margins.  At these PE levels one must start to wonder if stock buybacks make sense.   Also for the investor who has ben on the sidelines due to high valuations one must ask the question is FB to good of a deal to pass up?  I predict crazy tomorrow. Happy hunting!

148	1	 For all of those who have stayed true to the following teachings set forth by Jerome Powell on March 18, 2020, you are about to be rewarded! Our lord has not abandoned us yet! He will let the autists know that no interest rate will happen until we can be sure wheat and oil will stabilize, and China stop being a little bitch and stands up to the flu!  When is the last time YOU made a sacrifice to your lord and Savior J POW? Such a sacrifice includes acts such as letting a put expire worthless every week. But recently, puts don't expire worthless for most autists. And J POW has grown angry. To please him, you should have bought those puts further out the money. If you didn't then you just fucked up and need to read on...  This week, our Lord and Savior J POW shall seek vengeance on all of you who have not made a proper sacrifice since October 2021, or ever. He shall wipe out your puts and print every single OTM call in existence. Of course, if you haven't made the proper sacrifices over the years, then any OTM calls you buy will find a way to expire worthless, so don't bother. All this has already been said since the beginning of time if you knew how to read and just went back to early March 2020..

381	0	Happy "Soviet Red" Monday, apes.   It seems that Russia came to fuck shit up this week.   [Article (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/russia-hikes-key-rate-20-tells-companies-sell-fx-2022-02-28/)  Can't spell "Putin" without "Put".  Do what you wish with this information.   TL;DR - Russia CB raised interest rates to 20%, ordered companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues.   If they can even access Moex, that is.
345	0	There has been a recent wave of negative press around the investor but my view is that Cathie will be on a complete league of her own years from now.   I don‚Äôt invest in ARK but appreciate their worldview and practice. Its also my view that the nature of people like Cathie will automatically draw negative press, doubters, and haters. There will be a day where these view factually incorrect. Many of her critics are novices with poor understanding of long-term markets and the rate of innovation occurring in the technology sector.    Disclaimer: I invest heavily into financial technology and social media stocks. I don‚Äôt care what happens in the market; investing in financial technology, social media, or electric vehicles (not my expertise) is as common sense as it gets)
134	1	A plan to make cars by leading Chinese ride-hailing platform Didi may be officially released in June this year, while deliveries may begin in June next year, domestic media outlet Cyber Auto reported on Tuesday, citing an individual familiar with the matter.  Didi‚Äôs internal carmaking business code is ‚Äúda Vinci,‚Äù and its current team has about 1,700 people, located in Shunyi District, Beijing. The first model developed by Didi may target the consumer market. With a code name of C1, the new model is priced at about 150,000 yuan ($23,521), with a size similar to BYD‚Äôs Qin series and GAC‚Äôs AION S.

What stocks are you going to buy?   https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-08-22/index.html  Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to restrict or prohibit imports and exports of certain products and raw materials from Russia in 2022, but a list of those products that will be restricted and/or prohibited has yet to be defined by the government, Russian state media RIA reports, quoting the decree on special foreign economic measures aimed to ensure Russia‚Äôs security.  The government will have to define the list of states to be covered by these decisions within two days, RIA says, but adds these restrictions will not cover products or raw materials being transported by citizens for their personal needs.  Putin's ban comes as US President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that his administration is banning Russian energy imports ‚Äî including oil, natural gas and coal ‚Äî in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Debt pay down to 3 Billion USD by end of year 3. P.E Ratio is 8 compared to peers like Devon Energy that have a PE of &gt;12 4. Free cashflow yield for 2022 is at 39%, assuming $98 WTI and $3.85 natural gas - By summer oil should be much higher fyi. 5. They have met criteria for S&amp;P 500 inclusion - just a matter of when for the funds to start to start adding it to their portfolio 6. Second dividend increase in 6 months - meaning for the apes keeping just stocks in their portfolio you can buy ramen noodles for your girlfriend and her boyfriend every 3 months using cold hard cash.  I have been in these positions for a while and have been adding every dip. I believe there is still more room to grow judging from the PE ratio compared to peers, positive debt reduction and consistent dividend increase.

946	1	interesting... just saw another channel forming on the 30 min... using the high from 1/26 and 1/28 and the lows from 1/25 and 1/28...  now the question is will we choose the red dotted channel thats bullish or the white solid channel thats bearish. ü§îü§î.  IF we open lower monday and do not trade higher at all pre market the white channel is definitely in play and like many of us are thinking monday will be a dip day... which gives us room to dip as low as 426 (thatd be 3.9% dip from fridays close... not impossible actually when you factor in we dipped 3.9% last monday üò¨).  if we are trading in the red dotted channel our highs near 447.5 (1.2% higher than close) and our lows near 428 (only 3.1% from the high).  Monday is definitely going to be a very interesting day and a very telling day. depending on which way we move and how fast/ volatile we move we can invalidate one or both of these channels real quick. im pretty confident we will be choosing one this week though.  looking at monday though... i see the 30 min rsi is 65 and the 1 hour rsi is 64 with both MACDs ready to signal sell... id be shocked if we opened much higher monday and didnt see at least a sell off down into the mid to high 430s. a 2% dip puts us at 433.  kinda mad i gotta work tomorrow night and will be sleeping till power hour and miss all the action. hoping to jump in around 3pm on whatever up or down trend we are on to grab some quick gains though. at the time of writing this futures turned green from red but are not really up all that much. cry*pto (which honestly i believe more than anything else when it comes to market direction) is very red and has been all day continuing to sell off. based on that i am willing to bet we see a dip tomorrow. https://i.imgur.com/JA4gxod.jpeg https://i.imgur.com/aGjtlwc.jpeg https://i.imgur.com/tdCZwuJ.jpeg  Reminder- im back to work tomorrow and will be back to my normal sleeping till power hour and trading the last hour so wont be on here to respond to your guys DMs and comments. I will be posting the daily spy updates though just might not be till later into the night when ive got time at work.   Dont forget to follow me to stay up to date as my posts usually get removed but i post to my profile regularly and never remove those!  Note- i added a link to my venmo on my profile. Let me make this clear there is NO OBLIGATION at all to donate anything. I love hearing how you guys are making money with my TA. but some have expressed wanting to donate so i set my venmo up as a means to do that. Again no obligation right now... someday when i get a twitch or discord setup is when id make some sort of small affordable fee.

Stocks are more overpriced than a Dollar Tree selling stuff for $2 due to inflation, when suddenly the fairy godmother (played by Jerome Powell) comes out and transforms pumpkins into tendies by waiving his magical printer wand.  Great times are had by all, and your wife is about to get a new bf named Prince Charming, when all of the sudden you look up at the clock and it's about to strike midnight‚Äîand the party will be over because the fairy godmother's council has decided that pumping magic into the economy's veins faster than a $200K liberal arts degree destroys net worth is probably not a sustainable path.    Not that they want to turn it off, mind you, just move it 0.50 steps towards "normal".  Everyone panics, we've all gotten fatter than Gus Gus by YOLO'ing at anything because literally everything is up the last 2 years (plus the last 10), and we're not used to having to deal with (no)fundamentals beyond calls = $$$.  But then, right as the clock is about to hit midnight, time freezes faster than Elsa on speed‚Äîthe fairy godmother's council has been distracted Rasputin wreaking terror abroad, and have decided to only move things 0.25 steps back instead of 0.50, since the war has added panic and they don't want to spook the party top much.  And since things are riding so ridiculously high on magic fairy dust that the difference between 0.25 steps back and 0.50 steps back is literally more important than the world being on fire, because an on-fire horse and carriage still can haul more than the non-fire mice and pumpkins it really should be.  TL;DR: üêª = RIP, until rates finally start actually rising, and then everyone = RIP. Congrats on wasting 2 minutes of your life reading this.
927	1	It‚Äôs not a normal ‚Äì or low risk ‚Äì trading practice to amass a securities position that‚Äôs nearly five times the total economic output of Cambodia‚Ä¶ or 1.5 times the market capitalization of the major global bank you‚Äôre working for. It‚Äôs even less normal if the bank you‚Äôre working for has no clue about what you‚Äôre doing. Jerome Kerviel was a junior level derivatives trader earning US$66,000 per year at Societe Generale, one of Europe‚Äôs largest banks By January 9, 2008, he had amassed a stock index futures position of US$73 billion. The way he did so ended up costing Societe Generale (SocGen) US$7.2 billion ‚Äì six times what Nick Leeson lost for Barings.   Derivatives are investment instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset, like a stock, a market index, the price of oil and so forth. There are different kinds of derivatives like futures, options, forwards and swaps that track the underlying asset in different ways.  Kerviel had dug himself a hole by buying 30 billion euros‚Äô worth of Eurostoxx pan-European stock index futures contracts, 18 billion euros of Germany‚Äôs DAX futures and 2 billion euros of London‚Äôs FTSE futures. These contracts expired over the following 1 to 3 months. Futures are derivatives used to essentially bet on the future price of a stock index. Kerviel bought them in the hope these markets would go up over the following months.  Kerviel‚Äôs job was to profit when two securities that should have the same price temporarily don‚Äôt have the same price ‚Äì which is called arbitrage. The idea is to buy the cheaper security, sell the more expensive one, and then wait for their prices to converge.  For example, if the stock price for Coca-Cola is trading at US$45 on the New York Stock Exchange, but the equivalent of US$44.90 on the London Stock Exchange, an arbitrage trader would be short Coca-Cola in New York (to profit when the price goes down), and buy it, or go long, in London (to profit when the price rises.) Then when the prices converge, with one going higher, the other lower, he makes money.   Kerviel bought Euro stock market futures hoping they would go up. Normally, he would have offset these bets by, for instance, shorting U.S. stock index futures (to profit if markets go down). In this way, if European stocks suddenly fell, the short U.S. stock futures ‚Äì which tend to move in the same direction as European stock futures ‚Äì would make money, offsetting the loss.  Because the price difference between similar securities may be small (in the Coca-Cola example, the 10- cent difference is an enormous spread for arbitrage traders), it‚Äôs normal for arbitrage traders to buy huge positions, and use leverage, or borrowed money, to make them even larger. That way they can make big profits even if the difference in price is tiny.  However, in the months leading up to January 9, 2008, Kerviel had learned how to hack SocGen‚Äôs risk surveillance system and was only doing one half of the arbitrage trade. In other words, Kerviel had been taking, say, long positions and offsetting them with short positions that didn‚Äôt exist.  By manipulating the bank‚Äôs software, he was making risky one-sided bets when his firm thought he was making lower-risk arbitrage trades. Kerviel reportedly made nearly US$2 billion in profits in 2007 by making these kinds of unauthorized trades.   Astoundingly, it was later discovered by SocGen that the massive trade Kerviel entered in early January 2008 was actually an attempt by Kerviel to lose money. (It worked extremely well.) He believed the previous year‚Äôs US$2 billion in unauthorised bank profits was about to be discovered. He feared he might lose his job, and was trying to generate losses to mask his fraud.  This may explain why Kerviel was betting on markets going higher, despite the fact that the subprime mortgage crisis was just beginning. Global markets were looking wobbly and astute traders were going short, or betting on markets going down ‚Äì the opposite of what Kerviel was doing.  The first indication that something was wrong at SocGen came in the afternoon of Friday January 18, when a compliance officer discovered that a trade had exceeded the bank‚Äôs risk threshold. When he checked with a brokerage that had supposedly executed an offsetting trade, he learned that no such trade existed.  In the last hour of trading on January 18, the price of SocGen stock plunged 8 percent. News sources reported that speculation of impending huge write-downs at the bank was the cause of the decline. Apparently, word of Kerviel‚Äôs huge bet had leaked out.   As the extent of the fraud became apparent to banking officials over that weekend, Kerviel was fired. However, bank executives still had to deal with the US$73 billion worth of long futures, which at that point had already lost the bank US$1.4 billion.  Indications were that Monday‚Äôs stock market was going to experience more weakness ‚Äì no doubt made worse by the rumors that SocGen was in trouble. Bank executives were faced with a choice: Let the unauthorised trades run their course and hope the stock market would eventually rally, or close the positions immediately to avoid losing even more money.  After a difficult debate, with the future of the bank possibly at stake, bank officials decided to sell the positions as quickly as possible. FromJanuary 21 to 23, SocGen ‚Äúunwound‚Äù the futures contracts purchased by Kerviel, selling them into the market. Selling US$73 billion worth of futures in that short period of time drove prices of the futures even lower ‚Äì making the bank‚Äôs losses worse.  When the last of the unauthorised positions was sold, and the dust had settled, Jerome Kerviel had lost SocGen US$7.2 billion, making him the worst rogue trader in history, at least in terms of money lost.
911	1	Alright so ive been exclusively trading SPY options since last year, however, i recently stumbled upon an article explaining how QQQ has an advantage over SPY when it comes to options trading... i did some testing and im kinda surprised to see the results.   So lets break this down and im open for people's opinions here...   SPYs top 10 holdings are apple, msft, google, amazon, berkshire, j&amp;j, p&amp;g and nvidia which those top 10 holdings make up 28% of its total asset weight.  QQQs top 10 holdings are apple, msft, google, amazon, tesla, nividia, paypal and adobe which those 10 make up 56% of its total asset weight.   So comparatively its safe to say QQQ is easily swayed by its top 10 holdings while SPY isnt necessarily. Which accounts for why QQQ will usually move more in one day than SPY.   Something else i wanted to compare was IV and overall gains/ losses.   So lets take February 11th as an expiration. Say we take the next OTM call option for both spy and qqq for yesterday and compare them...  SPY $450C had a premium of $6.17 at end of day and would have returned 50.12% gains.  While QQQ $364C had a premium of $6.19 at end of day but would have returned 120.39% gains. Thats nearly triple the gains...  Its noted the spread on the QQQ call was 0.10 while SPY was only 0.05.   Now assume we were wrong and we bought the next otm put.  SPY $449p is $7.02 and would have returned -41%.  Qqq $363P is $7.42 and returned -49.5%.   So had you been wrong you would have only lost 8.5% more but had you been right itd been 2.5x the gains for roughly the same premium.   Spy volume- 152.5M Qqq volume- 94.3M   So this leads me to the question. Is QQQ actually better when it comes to options trading than SPY?

941	1	We recently got the news that tech/intelligence firm Palantir (PLTR) bought $50 million worth of physical gold to hold on its balance sheet.   On Aug. 17, it was reported that the company bought $50.7 million in gold bars as part of its internal investment strategy. In an interview, COO Shyam Sankar stated that the purchase ‚Äúreflects more of a worldview ‚Ä¶ You have to be prepared for a future with more black swan events.  Palantir bought $50 million in gold bars in August, the company disclosed in its latest earnings statement. The move reflects a growing company stashing cash in an unconventional asset in response to economic uncertainty spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and governments' response to it    So why do you think they bought it ?

815	0	Yesterday (3 February) at 12:37pm, someone bought 4,648x $30 CALLS the day before expiration. Cost between $1.00 to $1.05 so let's say the average was $1.02 per contract. That is...  (4,648 x 100) x $1.02 = $474,096  The price reached $38.99 AH, meaning, they likely gained...  464,800 x $9.00 = $4,183,200  Note: $9.00 is roughly the difference between 30C and current price (AH) assuming the price doesn't drastically change before the opening bell.  This is one example. There's thousands and thousands of calls at different strikes. Only looking at SNAP.  How many stocks took a drive today only to rebound AH? How many of them have thousands of "last minute" calls or puts which happens to be In The Money (ITM) now?!?!

Perhaps inflation is even cutting into their production costs. Like the benevolent movie theater killers that they are they just was to provide more content for families across The world so we can all escape our miserable lives and spend as much time in front of the TV watching mind numbing content. I love eating tendies on the couch, pounding beer and watching Movies. Besides watching all of you degenerates lose small fortunes and posting your losses online‚Ä¶zoning out on my couch is one of my favorite pastimes. Why? Cus im a lazy fat American.   However. I dont want to pay 20 bucks a month to do it. So I propose this. There are a little over 11 million users on Wallstreet Regrets, even if half of you cancel your membership that will create a reasonable downside to this rate hike. Hell tell your friends and family too (ya know the ones who arent using your subscription to Netflix) and maybe we can put a real dent in their bottom line. In other words. Fuck your Netflix calls, cancel your subscription and buy puts.   This is my first shitpost. Not amazing i know im more of a meme guy myself. Have a great Saturday night. Maybe watch Hulu tonight instead
184	0	So I made a post where I've lost nearly 100k in the last few months trying to play options (sadly lost more since). Last year I started off the year with 170k in value and ended the year with about 162k in value according to statements. However, Robinhood shows that due to wash sales, I made 21k.   Is it possible to pay taxes even if I'm losing money overall? I read that I can use tax harvesting so I can use 3k to offset these losses until I'm cleared. I know I became extra retarded in the name of greed so I would like to know how you can mitigate this.   This year I started off at 160k and now I'm sitting at ..... 71k (I'm numb and can't feel pain anymore) and I'm sure I'm falling under wash sales again because I bought same SPY/QQQ/TSLA etc. contracts multiple times and ended up losing even more money. What will this mean for me for rest of the year?  You can laugh at me losing money but definitely could use some understanding of this stupidity. Also, how come brokers don't warn you about potential wash sales when making these decisions?

817	0	Tell me what you retards think about Lyft. I know one of you fuckers have to know more than I do. I‚Äôm planning on buying puts before their earnings on Tuesday.   It seems like their prices have gone up to what I‚Äôm guessing is due to a supply sided shortage. So I‚Äôm bearish from that point of view.  They haven‚Äôt expanded into anything along the lines of grocery / food delivery like Uber. I‚Äôm hedging with some calls just in case they release that they are expanding into delivery markets or some other outlandish news that is bullish. But from a profitability standpoint I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs viable for them. Look at doordash eating complete shit recently.  Apart from that, I don‚Äôt see another way for Lyft to have much upside unless they do really well on earnings which is still possible. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely.  I will be looking to buy some puts sometime over the next few days. I‚Äôm probably just being retarded and not seeing the whole picture. What cases are there for Lyft to be bullish?

677	1	I know, another Telsa DD. But trust me, this one is *the DD*. Whether you are Tesla bull or bear I really recommend to read it. No emotions, minimum speculations, just raw impartial numbers. We are not going to [faint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU&amp;t=75s) over competitor's thermal system or argue on how many years Tesla is ahead of competition. Let's once and for all answer the question: is Tesla overvalued, undervalued or ... fairly valued?   # Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)  Let's start with the *typical* bull thesis. The one you probably encountered thousands time in the wilderness of reddit or (trying not to vomit...) twitter. It goes like this:  * Tesla will grow car production and sales by 50% annually for foreseeable future... Eventually, reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393) * Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021), because of 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even [Alien dreadnought](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-revives-his-alien-dreadnought-factory-dream-for-batteries-2020-9?op=1) will eventually happen? * Tesla is a *tech company*. They will make shit tons of money by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and even eventually launch their own marketplace (akin to AppStore). * Tesla is... [*ETF*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5-2xfZmwR0)*?* * Tesla sexbot. Enough said.  Let's start with an automotive sales part:  * Say Tesla is so Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). In Q4 2021 Tesla reported 15.653B of automotive sales without regulatory credits and 308.65K cars delivered, resulting in ASP of $50.7K. I know that automotive sales include other things as well, but it's good enough approximation.  * Assume the prices will increase by an average of \~3% annually due to inflation (in hopes that current inflation spike will subside). By end of 2030, **ASP of Tesla would be 50.7K x 1.03****^(9)** **= 66.2K**. * With **net margins of 13%** that would result in 66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = **$172B net income**.  * Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and will somewhat converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers (note, we are looking at automotive business now): Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla is Tesla, so we take an automotive **Tesla PE - 15**. * Tesla market cap in 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. That can't be right! An absolute leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD with outstanding operating margins (\~twice the industry average) with PE also about twice the industry average will only triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)? * Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to NPV of 2.58 / (1.07^(9)) = **1.4T\*,** so *... Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued?*  Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth (beating inflation by 4% in our example) instead of investing into SPY?  * From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B) it will return you (2.58/0.89)^((1/9)) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.  But careful ~~Tesla stan~~ observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the thesis above?  # Chapter 2. Automotive market or "bulls are fukd".  Many analyses that I read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply, arguing that the ramp up of the existing factories as well as the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching (bull) 20M by 2030. What they fail to address is TAM, which is the EV market in 2030.   No doubt the market will be enormous by 2030. In particular, EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/)), China plan to transition 100% to so-called "New Energy vehicles" (that include plug-in hybrids) by 2035 ([source](https://www.autonews.com/china/china-explores-ambitious-goal-ev-sales-2035)), and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html)). In my opinion, it is logical to conclude that Plug-in Hybrids + BEVs are unlikely to capture 100% of World's automotive market, especially given that 30% of all cars are sold outside of EU, China and USA ([source](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/passenger-car-sales-by-key-region-2010-2020e), i.e. places like South America, Africa, CIS region, etc. where penetration of EVs should not be expected to be high even in 2030). So, even if we assume 90% penetration rate we are being overly optimistic and generous.   According to [McKenzie](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/disruptive-trends-that-will-transform-the-auto-industry), we should expect around 2% annual growth of automotive volumes sales. From 2021's approx. 80-85M cars sold it leads to 95-101M cars to be sold in 2030. With 90% penetration rate the upper bound for all EV vehicles (plug-in hybrids + BEVs) is 90M cars (again, let me remind how obnoxiously bullish these assumptions are).   This is how EV sales look so far according to [EV-Volumes.com](https://EV-Volumes.com):   https://preview.redd.it/1dsy1udkmah81.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad813de026aa40b5acb772351d5a92bd368223bd  It's easy to estimate Tesla's market share from this graph:  * 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%** * 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%** * 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%** * 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%**  I don't want to raise an alarm or anything, but it looks like Tesla's market share peaked at 16.2% and already is starting to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe, to my taste, to make conclusions on the trend\*. But is difficult not to make a connection between the loss of Tesla's market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy OEMs.  *\*Although I really enjoy observing how TSLA bulls update their trends based on one good month for example.*   You could argue on this point, but in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Think about the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. According to Elon himself target for Cybertruck is 250K annual production, so we are left with an already 10-year-old design Model S with some facelift and 5-year-old design Model 3. I consider Model X and Model Y being an SUV versions of S and 3 respectively with basically same designs (I am talking about aesthetics and not engineering aspects). We observed firsthand how this affected Model S/X sales:  https://preview.redd.it/x2p8zuwtuah81.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cd6fb1a72ef5fadd3890a7441f03c689174bd7  whereas the effect on Model 3/Y is yet to be seen.  It is not difficult to understand why. Unlike a smartphone or a smartwatch, if you buy a new car for $60K, you want to make damn sure people around are aware it's a new car for $60K and not 7-year old one for the price of $25K. (See I didn't have to touch upon quality or lagging ramp up of service center vs total produced cars over the last 5 years, etc.).   As the result, by taking an obnoxiously bullish estimate of 90M EV cars by 2030 along with (still IMO bullish) 13.9% of Tesla's market share results in 90 x 0.139 = **12.5M cars.** Which is 37.5% lower than 20M cars of the ultimate bull thesis. This as the result leads to **1.61T** valuation by end of 2030, or **6.8% percent annual growth** (it's a rookie number in this racket)**.** We already approaching the point where automotive sales alone (unlike what some of the TSLAnalysts want you to believe) cannot justify current valuation.   # Chapter 3. "Get rich or die trying"  This is in fact a continuation of the previous chapter, but I figured it was already too long. Let's touch the second point from original bull estimate, which is ASP (average selling price).   Perhaps for people who HODLed TSLA for more than 5 years, throwing a 50K at a car is no biggie. Fun fact, *TSLA* is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car *Tesla* ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz "announced" 100K order from *Tesla*, *TSLA* jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn't we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current TSLA hodlers? khm....    Back from philosophy, for many non-TSLA hodlers 50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 12.5M cars (for reference Toyota guided FY2022 (calendar 2021) sales of 8.25M cars), it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing models or introduce cheaper ones. *Especially* given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.   According to the latest [Toyota Financial report](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2022_3q_presentation_en.pdf), ASP for Toyota cars are 23.3T yen / 6.1M = 3.8M yen or 33K USD (in reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services). But Tesla is no Toyota, Tesla is better in every way imaginable. So let's assume that despite the pressures of the competition, Tesla manages to keep the current ASP for half of the sales (again bullish assumption). Whereas the other half will come from a cheap model. No one hopes for $25K anymore, give us at least $35K model Elon! So the ASP becomes: $50.7K x 0.5 + $35K x 0.5 = $43K, adjusted for inflation (x 1.03^(9)) - **$56K** or 15% lower than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.   So the results so far, TSLA by end 2030 - **$1.37T** valuation, or **4.9%** annual return if you invest today. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in the models.   **Margins.**  One topic I will not really touch is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand things like Gigacasting or structural batteries might or might not help to increase margins. But drawback of the latter is much lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties cost. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.   **My own biased opinion on the numbers.**   I claimed that the numbers we used above are rather bullish. If I am tob make a guess on EV penetration (PHEV + BEV), Tesla's market share and ASP, my decision would fall on the following:  * PHEV + BEV penetration - 75% (still rather bullish IMHO) * Tesla market share - 10% (same, rather bullish) * ASP - 38K x 1.03^(9) = 50K,  Plugging in the numbers (with the same margins) we obtain: 75M x 0.1 (market share) x 50K x 0.13 (net margins) x 15 (PE) = **$731B valuation by end 2030**. If I wanted a 10% annual return from a single stock (vs. 7% of SPY), I would pay no more than $310B or **276 USD per share now.**   Before you say it's outrageous:  1. We looked only at car sales business 2. Note how this model still results in TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. High growth is a blessing, but the **expectation of high growth over the long timeframe is a risk.**  However, when we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting investors to hell:   [Source: https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/stocks\/charts\/TSLA\/tesla\/shares-outstanding](https://preview.redd.it/t3yw2cnp9bh81.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63d04547b1b708369151452e47282f6067d3a5f9)  Given the expected growth (ramp ups of existing ~~factories,~~ sorry Gigafactories) as well as introduction of new models, etc. will definitely result in more fund raising (i.e. forget about any buybacks before 2030 for sure).   On top of that Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to receive crazy stock compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply side of things (and I am too smooth brained and by now drunk to discuss it now).   # Chapter other product lines of Tesla:  As for the other product lines, it's difficult to judge now as they are in their very infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity:    https://preview.redd.it/bl00qqaxbbh81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3fcf7ea30f814816348dcfbec1badd914b133cf  Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing so far:  https://preview.redd.it/anc8ocxccbh81.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87b5e4e97704058c04a638dfdad605fe9230a184  &amp;#x200B;  However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money:  https://preview.redd.it/3ed30zlqcbh81.png?width=1678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cbb15884ecfb227650c40de2872229e89b3690d  It's often not clear how a company calculates gross margin, but losing money on the gross margin (in contrast to operating margin) is actually a very bad sign. It means that the cost of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla is spending $100 to buy solar tiles and another $50 for shipping, and $200 for a labor to install it, and sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include (depends on the company) general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc.  The TAM by itself is very arguable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/10-biggest-solar-companies-5077655)) have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla's valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.   # Chapter Hype: Fraud Self Driving:  This one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*   Since Tesla doesn't share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the  prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.   After your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Again, if you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry starting all the way from Darpa's challenges and even before.   But if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short distance. Elon straightforward lies when he claims that Tesla is in the phase of marching nines. They would often obfuscate it with Beta release notes such as "Recall rate for pedestrian detection increased by X%" (Often times you can already derive that they are not in the marching nine phase). And all of the quantitative release notes are only related to the sensing part of the system, i.e. nothing about decision making. How good their decision making is getting? The reason is that the planning side of things are still hard-coded by engineers and they apparently have no way of quantifying the progress on the equally important part of the system. But I promised no engineering discussion.   In comparison, in 2020 Waymo's disengagement rate was at 1 per 11000 miles, which is the order of magnitude difference. Before you argue that Waymo is geofenced and the Tesla is not, you should realize that the latter practically doesn't work at all.   Back to numbers, in average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/)). Now let's say that not all FSD disengagements are that bad (like are you f\*\*king kidding me right now?), and most of them wouldn't result in dangerous situation. Let's say 90%. Fuck it - 99%. That is still 1 disengagement per   # Chapter History.  Folks at one particular subreddit love to compare Tesla to Enron. IMO the comparison is weak. What I personally like to compare Tesla to is *Cisco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was *the stonk* in 2000. Unlike Tesla though (at least so far), Cisco actually was the **World's biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. To understand it, 2000 were so long ago (hard to believe) that the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)), SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today's dollars (side note, Microsoft and Apple being both above 2T hint at the level of consolidation not seen for a very long time, if ever).  And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-09-13/cisco-could-be-the-safest-net-play-around) claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/03/20/story2.html) Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years (again, we are talking year 2000 here). At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?  In the chart above you see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven't recovered to it's ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -22%. And the thing is, unlike Enron, Cisco is the real solid company with current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. It's just it was too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.  It doesn't really matter whether Tesla is 5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth? Whether or not it is a good investment (or bet).  # Chapter WSB. How to lose money on this  Well, I am no financial advisor, so go long, go short, you do you. Personally, I am shorting. However, it is not without a risk. Tomorrow Tesla announces start of Cybertruck production (or Roadster) and stock will start mooning because... reasons? As if Cybertruck or Roadster are not priced in.   My post is a bit late (actually I started writing in November 2020 but had to postpone due to important deadlines at work), but my preferred strategy for Bears would be:  * Start accumulating OTM put leaps. Choose strike as to adjust your total delta according to your [personal risk tolerance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d80ahvRSV8E). Better yet, if you can afford to lose your total premium. * Choose DTE as to not worry about theta for at least half a year (interest rate increase? market correction?), i.e. expiry for a year out. * I know it's not a WSB style, but you don't have to wait for puts to get ITM (even if they do you might still lose when all said an done). Just offload the bags back onto market makers during the next huge volatile price dump (again, overall market correction?) * You could hedge with calls at times of strong momentum (like October run up from 800 to 1200), or when you see that it is in the short term oversold (RSI &lt; 20ish).  IMO if there is a better time to short, it's probably now at the prices around 900-1000 (or earlier at 1200). Then again, so thought all the shorters when Tesla reached 500...  **For Bulls: HODL or something... You have the likes of Tesla Daily, Dave Lee, Gary Black to give you advises.**  **Bulls good luck on your trip to the moon. My fellow Bears, see you in fucking Valhalla!**
777	1	Canada Goose ($GOOS) stock is usually pretty volatile after earnings, with a pattern of strong directional moves following results and guidance. The stock surged from $37 to $53 during the two weeks that followed the Q3 2021 report, but has since been falling all the way back down to $31. As one can expect, Q4 has historically been the most profitable quarter for the company, driven by an increase in the sale of jackets in preparation for the winter season.  A quick look at Google Trends points to a slightly increased interest over the brand compared to winter 2020, hinting to potentially greater sales: [https://i.imgur.com/t2e6Er5.png](https://i.imgur.com/t2e6Er5.png)  They did raise guidance for the full year 2021 last quarter. I was potentially looking at calls here, but two things do slightly worry me:  * EPS estimate for Q4 2021 remans in my view very high ($1.16), which doesn't leave much room for error. In this market environment, an earnings miss could send the stock sensibly further down * According to the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), winter 2021/2022 outlook points to ‚Äú*warmer-than-normal temperatures \[...\] across the southern and eastern United States*‚Äù and ‚Äú*colder-than-normal temperatures \[...\] in much of Alaska, and from the Pacific Northwest east into the Dakotas*‚Äù (see the map [here](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/long_range/lead01/off01_temp.gif)) ‚Äî a pretty mixed picture, but factoring in the fact that eastern states are the most populated ones, the perspective of a warmer end of season could lead the company to slightly downgrade its guidance for next year  I'm still researching the stock and am probably missing a few more elements. What are you thoughts on upcoming earnings? Do you see $GOOS beating expectations?
829	0	So just like what the title says, I think trading shares is a much better way to day trade in this market. It‚Äôs just so volatile that your options could expire literally worthless. The risks are much lower seeing how you don‚Äôt have to worry about the Greeks. No expiration. Just a lot less risky. BUT you need a decent size starting amount to make decent money trading just shares. When i had about $2k I traded options but then realized that the more money i had the riskier it was to trade options. So starting this year i only day trade with shares and a starting account size of $50k. What are your opinions?

Our economy has  more than doubled in 1.5 years while most employers laid people off ‚Äúsars 2‚Äù And had a reduction in production  Anyone following the stock market knows this is insane and America is on the verge of another recession, with very few companies meeting EPS estimates with a negative future outlook   The billions in stimulus and fed bond buying went to far. Currently sitting at a year over year inflation of 7.4  with fed talking about doing a full point raise by July. ( currently pricing in a .5-.75) And we are fearful of the impact of a primary military conflict would have on the economy,   How about you think about that before you degrade the dollar by 12% ‚Äú actual‚Äù and send trillions to other countries while we let our local businesses fail    A war with Russia would take crude price at a minimum to $117 a barrel and start us into a recession.  On the other hand we would have to get more involved in the war to counter the effects of supply chain and our dependence on foreign companies. Commodities go Brrrrr.   ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ üò©
875	0	First of all, why not CRSR? Beaten down AF. They make good shit. Market no where near saturated (how many people you know out here building PCs?). 30+% of the float is currently shorted.   &amp;#x200B;  Seems like a r/wsb wet dream. Like, why not do with $CRSR what you did with $GME. No shit, I was driving to Wendy's to harass the employees the other day, and see a license plate "GMESTOP". Ape power is real.      APES! BUY CRSR!   Also the fundamentals are really good, unlike gamestop lol. They just a simple company, run by detail oriented virgins who jerk off to cable management videos on youtube. Giving the people what they want at a variety of price points and aesthetics. They make fucking everything. Positioning as a luxury brand... not a mainstream segment so growth always limited but goddamn I know the PC gaming community grew with the pandemic.   Speaking of growth if you apes can read, check out their 10ks and financial releases... projecting themselves most recently to double in size by 2026. That is solid growth, and is achievable IMO, and I'm a lot smarter than you. If it executes, $CRSR will grow similarly to $AMD during that period, and is sure to become some kind of hedge fund darling. In the meantime... shorts are covering this Friday...   &amp;#x200B;  $20 calls 2/4 EXP if you do FDs.... this is not financial advice.... should print.
824	0	To those who put their best effort to write their best DD and share knowledge freely, you have my bow, my axe, and my butt for your use at any time.   To all the shills, Fuck You,  To the bullheaded morons who cant look at the facts and chirp and repeat something because of their strong-held opinions or because something is perceived to be impossible. I feel sorry for you. Because you let your emotions guide you and  life will blind side you - its only a matter of time.   To those who still have one wrinkle in their brain and can at least have an open mind think about these facts:  1. Something unprecendented happened in 2020. 500 million chinese were locked in their apartments due to a virus. The market didnt flinch an inch. I did 30 minutes of research, 30 FUCKING MINUTES, and i knew the virus was probably going to be a problem. I turned on CNBC later that day and they stated "markets were strong and nothing was going to go wrong". Three weeks later the markets crashed. Is the MSM's goal really to inform or to manipulate? You tell me but remember Iraq, Nam, 08, etcc..... 2. This sub from 2017 until 2020 and during the virus was infamous for hilarious MEME's. MEMES were the power of this sub as they created the cultural backbone of this sub. Other stock subs were filled with pretentious dicks who wrote shitty D and pretended they were smart cause they knew more financial vocab. MEMEs and all forms of digital communication are another form of language. Banning the use of images, links, and MEMES is one of the most ridiculous things i have ever seen. Ask yourself why would this be banned? Why would you not want to see an image of the FED balance sheet? What the fuck is this shit? Why would the tongue of a culture be removed? During the slave years it was imperative to strip the people of their culture. Ask yourself why???????  3. There is a stonk, that if mentioned brings out a wave of hate. There is a stonk with a subreddit completely dedicated to hating it because it is a bad investment. Im sorry but if that is the case then where the fuck are the tanker subreddits dedicated to hating that stock? Where are the biotech subreddits dedicated to hating those stocks? Where are the RKT mortgage stocks dedicated to hating that stonk?  4. Last year, that one true stonk had its buy button removed, it was unprecedented. If you dont understand the significance of an unpreceded event then look at note 1 above - its a major clue to something being fucked up. Now that one stonk has been constantly ridiculed by MSM. It has been labeled any name to make it sound unsophisticated and retarded. It has been labedled as a complete conspiracy theory and yet many of the theories are now actually being talked about on the MSM and known as fact.   Lastly, this is WallStreet Fucking Bets. Why in the fuck would you not want to place a bet with limited downside and huge upside? This is what this sub was about.  To the most recent post celebrating the removal of MEMES, fuck you. You said apes caused the memes. False. They existed for the entire life of this sub. So fuck you and thank you cause that means apes are way fucking cooler than you terds. if the apes are wrong then at least they have funny memes.
982	1	Read an article about how MTTR and HIMX could be the next big tech stock as the metaverse expands and becomes more established, and here is my thought. Himax technologies is a company that produces displays used in TVs, phones, monitors and VR headsets. Matterport operates as a spatial data company which its products include 3D content platform, pro2 3D cameras, 3D cameras, VR and mobile aps. It also serves real estate, construction, travel, and commercial sectors. My interest was in the virtual reality considering we are in the beginning stages in the metaverse, where the gateway into it will be virtual reality via VR headsets. If the metaverse explodes i can see these companys also exploding in value. Considering these tech stocks are currently trading at under $12 a share, and the current market is in a decline (including these 2 and one at $8 a share and still downward), im looking at these as having a fire sale right now. How do you all feel about the future of the metaverse and please shill me on why you think the metaverse is going to take off and become something big once it gets more developed

749	1	Thesis: Disney + / Vaccines / Reopening / Rising Prices  Disney + has taken Netflix's market share. There is a set market for video streaming and with Netflix's numbers coming out we saw they are not gaining as many users as before, my thesis is that Dis+ took most of it with better kid friendly content. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11f5bxylc0   We saw what Snap did when Facebook reported they were losing marketshare, I am adopting the same thesis to Disney taking Netflix marketshare. Not to mention Encanto being one of Disneys biggest movies this quarter - https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=encanto   On Vaccines we know that more and more people are vaccinated and with both theme parks open we should see more and more people heading to parks. With JnJ reporting massive vaccine sales we should see MRNA and PFE also report the same which just means more people are vaccinated. This ties into https://allears.net/2022/01/24/we-werent-ready-for-the-crowds-in-disney-world-today/ the huge number of people just visiting all the parks.   Genie+ / Fast pass - https://touringplans.com/blog/how-to-use-disney-genie-and-lightning-lane-at-disneyland/ - Disneyland pretty much said fuck it lets charge park goers an extra $30-$50 for the same experience to save time.    Technicals - We already saw a huge drop in DIS - https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmMP0itP/ trading at 2019 Pre Pandemic levels which is in par with the similar drops we've seen on major tech companies, so the drop is already in, with more R:R on the upside.

226	0	As stated in the title, I was recently just looking around in Tesla options and I was trying out different strategies to see what the profit and loss percentages was. And I tried using a butterfly spread on Tesla puts where all contracts had the same expiration date and it showed in the P/L graph that the max profit was $485 if Tesla‚Äôs price was at $855, and if Tesla didn‚Äôt stay within $850-$860, then my max loss would be -$15. It seems like I could lose way more money than just $15 so I came here to clarify.

493	0	TLDR: SP500 WILL FINISH $500-550 EOY WITH THE HELP OF PAST INVASION CHART PERFORMACES AND THE RAMS WINNING THE SUPERBOWL AND I'LL BE BUYING MONTHLY CALLS BECAUSE OF IT!!!!  &amp;#x200B;  Alright for starters I'm unable provide the DD I found on this sub earlier this morning (2/21) which was a correlation of when countries start invasions and the SP500, so if someone finds the gem of that DD please link it to me and I'll update this part.  **DD#1**  For now I'll summarize what I got out of it. There were 4-5 SP500 charts of different time periods when there were invasions from other countries and what happened to the SPY after. I noticed as did the OP, that at the time of invasions there were big dips followed by a steady bullish trend, except one üåà chart. This got me thinking about the whole Russia/Ukraine thing and if a similar pattern will occur since the invasion pretty much has commenced.  &amp;#x200B;  **DD#2**  Ok get ready for something even more bullish than some invasion charts that happened when your grandpa was snorting crayons on the front lines of WW2 and 'Nam. And that is that the Los Angeles Rams won the fucking Super Bowl and I've got some bullish metrics for you on top of the little invasions charts. Lets look at exhibit A:  https://preview.redd.it/dwlz4nyg5cj81.png?width=531&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d17efd030c1843859cd3e1e26d611014dc2fab1  So, Exhibit A basically speaks for itself. The right conference won the SB this year. Now let me turn you to Exhibit B, before I grab out my calculator with sticky keys and a jammed enter button:  https://preview.redd.it/xwjkyyqm5cj81.png?width=405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=001927ee9818dedf2800cf3d2456ab02cdfde3bc  &amp;#x200B;  Ight I'll get some things out of the way for those that don't give a shit about the NFL. The Rams team colors are blue/gold so I went with blue stats, Tom Brady did not play in this years SB, this years SB was in LA so Pacific Time, and unfortunately the Rams do have a mascot. If you don't know whether this year is odd/even you belong here. Given all those numbers this means the lowest expected return for the SP500 at the EOY is 6.3% and the most bullish case gets us 13.9% (Thanks Tom) with the average being 10.35% ( I added all percent groups for Rams categories for winning and did average of that).  &amp;#x200B;  **THE NUMBERS**  SP500 current price - $434.88 ( 2/18 close, also down 10.2%)  SP500 Beginning Year price - $479.66 (1/3 first trading day of new year)  SP500 EOY Price:  6.3% - $509.88  10.35% - $529.30  13.9% - $546.33  Now before you turn into a üåàüêª looking at these price targets, let me reassure you that I don't expect green for the next month or two because idk what would classify as an "invasion" period, but once the invasion period is over, not only will the SB winning Rams pump up the SP500 but so will the news that the invasions done and this will help reach this small yearly return needed for the SP500 to maintain averages. I'm also calculating my returns based on the beginning year price, so you can add 10% on top of those percentages listed up if you wanted to figure out what you'd get if you just buy the SP500.  &amp;#x200B;  **THE STRAT**  So why'd I go through all this trouble to educate you all on why there is a bullish market to be had the remaining of this year? Simple, I made a dumb bet in a comment chain that once Russia invaded I'd start buying SPY calls for the last Friday of each month in the morning before the invasion. So literally from the time I read DD#1 in the morning to just a merely 8 hours later, I was set to take on this bet. So here's my strategy given the following DD above.  \*My first call purchase will be on this Friday 2/25 for an option expiring on 3/25 since it's the last Friday of March and then the chain continues each month\*  Rules I'll follow:  1. $500-$1,000 per month in SPY calls only ( that's about 25-50% of my paycheck so luckily I moved up from Wendy's) 2. I will look for strike prices that have contracts costing $500 minimum and if I feel spicy I'll buy 2 max contracts going up to $1,000 but rounding up if needed by the thousands place. 3. Every thing is a monthly play, so I will only purchase next months option on the day a current one is expiring or near expiring (e.g. next month on 3/25 I buy calls for 4/29, last Friday of April) 4. All calls will start off as OTM some maybe deep OTM, idk the difference, and selling is only allowed for profit and can only be sold in the final 11 days of the contract because 11 is my highest favorite number. If it's a bad month I let the call expire and try next month ( this way I earn the full $3k losses to carryforward on taxesüòé) 5. I stop after 1 year of this experiment, so  2/24/23 will be the last SPY call that will fit this DD since by then a new SB winner will be crowned  Before I leave you all to roam free in the comments, I'll let you know the first call I'm looking at is at $448 since it's $5.23 per contract and fits the description. I'll be updating my results for when I purchase a call and sell a call. Other than that, not sure what other updates will be needed. This is also my first time doing an investment strategy publicly, so bare with me if the initial updates aren't smooth. Godspeed to all of you out there except the  üåàüêª and this is NFA, just green crayon snortin gainz waiting to happen.

69	1	Hi everyone, here's my latest bit of TA. Recently I have gotten  into Cummins stock for a couple of reasons. First of all, I know that there was a downgrade on Friday however the stock bounced strong ending the day at a HOD. it bounced on some of the highest volume I have seen for the stock in the past couple years which was weird. The volume was nearly 300% of it's 3 month average volume.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/PF90VOqh  Now for some TA. My analysis for this one is pretty simple, it broke daily resistance on Friday on very large volume. MACD  is bullish and rsi has room to run before it nears oversold territory. Additionally, Dow stocks and industrials in general have been hot during the most recent stock cycle and I predict it staying like this for a little longer. CUMMINS has also had a pretty good earnings recently l. Being a company with low debt, they tend to fair well when people move out of growth and stocks. Despite the crazy rally last week in the general market, I think things still look decent for the short term. Monday may be red so that things have a chance to cool off but it seems that the market is shrugging off the war for the time being. Anything can change but for now this is where I stand with Cummins stock.  As always, good luck to all this week!  Positions: 04/14 210c

You may think they're lame boomers that no one listens to because you lack any kind of contextual understanding and I get that, but a lot of the musicians you like have a lot of respect for them.  This could easily go viral and lead to other  major artists adding their name to the list (they love this kind of shit and def can be a herd).  I am, just for fun, going to lock in shorts at open on Monday in the event this happens.    Fuck Joe Rogan.

Congress is slow at making change, but we can make change by investing into green stock that we care about. If you invested in Tesla in 2012, you would've been 4127% richer. But Tesla isn't the only essential green stock.  [Here's the list I'm looking at.](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-green-stocks-to-buy?slide=2) Things like HASI and TE Connectivity are not going away.

380	1	Market is down 2% on futures. I guess it‚Äôs related to SWIFT related sanctions,m. Anyway, it seems that current events in Ukraine won‚Äôt have any major effect on the market. Yet, inflation will accelerate, pressuring Fed for a more Hawkish reaction.   I think Core CPI will also come higher than expected, driving the markets down, where it‚Äôd be a good buying opportunity. If the fed‚Äôs actions weren‚Äôt as aggressive as expected the market will rally. If not, most of it will probably be priced in.   What do you think?

There was no way this company would succeed with all the failures going on with SPACS. That said, I yolo'd some calls due to comps  ($FIVN &amp; $NICE) and the publicly available info some time after it [first announced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/livevox-to-go-public-through-spac-deal-with-crescent-acquisition) the SPAC merger.

($CRSA). Well, I got eaten alive by the SPAC bug. After the merger, $LVOX stock tanked due to a higher number of redemptions than was initially anticipated. The stock price went from a steady SPAC floor of \~$10 to a 52 week low of $4.20 (seen in chart below). Volume has decrease to practically nothing meaning current holders are doing just that. HOLDING.   &amp;#x200B;  [Courtesy of E\*Trade](https://preview.redd.it/kyqvitop2wh81.png?width=1725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=772d1b1c9d3284c36b79074b2c35be37d9f255c3)  Since the decline in price, I have increased my holdings in warrants and Call options. Here is my logic as to why I invested more even though I experienced some losses on it.   **My crazy logic to increasing holdings**  There are 6 reasons why I increased holdings:  1. $LVOX contracts are sticky, as in their contract revenue are highly predictable.  2. In 2Q2021, $LVOX announced a huge jump in cash spend for its Sales &amp; Marketing Team (seen on slide 21 of the[3Q2021 deck](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_6ac2336b265f7cb4c78689ec0a19e3f7/livevox/db/1912/17629/pdf/LIveVox+InvestorPresentation+November+2021+Final+Presentation.pdf)). This was unexpected and caused a further drop in stock price in Nov. '21.  3. In the 3Q2021 call, an equity analyst asked how long it takes for these sales reps to get up to speed where they are making an impact on the income statement. The CEO answered it typically takes 6 months. 4. On Page 15 of [the slide deck](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_6ac2336b265f7cb4c78689ec0a19e3f7/livevox/db/1912/17629/pdf/LIveVox+InvestorPresentation+November+2021+Final+Presentation.pdf), you will see a chart that outlines the increase in GTM Team Expansion. Tying those numbers to revenue, one can deduce that each new addition (conservatively) contributes \~$114k to revenues.  5. With an addition of 66 GTM team members from 3Q2021 from 4Q2020, we can calculate the 4Q2021 revenue impact of the larger sales force to be \~$7.5M. This is where it gets tricky because although I can calc that this will have an \~.08 cent impact on EPS, I cannot predict that all other costs will remain constant (as ratio'd to previous quarters) due to volatility. Thus, EPS cannot properly be guided without further cost info. from mgmt. (Thus, if you are investing in a company solely on EPS, this may not be an investment for you) 6. One of the original, large investors, Golden Gate Capital LLC,  that helped take LiveVox public [recently increased their holdings](https://investors.livevox.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-21-359810/d250225dsc13da.htm)  [from](https://investors.livevox.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-21-202173/0001193125-21-202173.pdf) 71.6M (post spac) to  72.0M shares of 91.4M (representing 73%).  In the [3Q2021 earnings release](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_6ac2336b265f7cb4c78689ec0a19e3f7/livevox/news/2021-11-11_LiveVox_Announces_Third_Quarter_2021_Financial_165.pdf), management guided that 4Q2021 Total Revenue would be expected to be in the range between $31.2 to $32.2 million. When I took the 3Q2020 revenues ( I know I should be using 3Q2021, but wanted to remain consistent to adequately track the growth in the sales team and its impact from 3Q2020 to 3Q2021) and added in the 7.5M growth, I came up with total revs of 32.94M. I think that this estimate is closer to reality (and guidance) than if we added that 7.5M to the 3Q2021 numbers, which would equal $38.04M. In either scenarios, Total Revenues beat the 4Q2021 guidance (range of $31.2-$32.2 M) from management.   For expenses, I used the ratio from 3Q2021 and applied that ratio to 4Q2021. Obviously, this is not the best way to calc as we all know that some costs will be fixed or variable. This method assumes that all are variable and highly correlated to revenues. The reason I chose this method is that it provides an *easy* avenue to predict those variable expenses. Thus, after calculating, I came up with conservative estimate of EPS of (.15). This essentially loses to [analyst expectations](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/lvox/earnings), but remember this also ignores the fixed components of expenses. Thus, I suspect that this might be the worst case scenario for earnings. In the best case scenario (revs @ $38M), where costs remain similar to 3Q2021, we get an EPS of (.06), which essentially beats the best case analyst scenario.   &amp;#x200B;  Thus, due to the increase in sales team headcount, I believe LiveVox will be able to further reign in its expenses and beat market expectations for revs and EPS in either its 4Q21 earnings OR its 1Q22 earnings. Please feel free to pick my analysis apart.

145	0	The stock market is a playground for the rich. It was always intended to be that way from its inception. In the old days, the big boys battled not you but **each other**! Whoever had the biggest dick was the winner. The losers got run out of town.   Fast forward to when electronic trading became available to the little guy. Now YOU get to play this oh-so-fun game! Remember the days when the brokers charged $50+ bucks for their sage advice? Well, that didn't last too long. People opted for doing their own trades, paying $10...$15...20 bucks for every trade. But as more and more brokers came, so did the commission wars. They dropped to $10...some as low as $5. Robinhood came on the scene and offered NO commissions.   Well, by golly...everyone started offering FREE trading! Wow...we were in heaven! This little shit that you are can now trade against Bill Gates and Warren Buffett! Well...not the directly, but the guys who suck their dicks.  Any of you play poker? You may play against your buddies or a bunch of strangers, but in any event, what you see on the table is all there is. If you win, you get the pot.   **The problem with Wall Street is that those fuckers invent new money whenever they lose to you**. The Fed prints. The companies reverse split or issue new shares. They drop share price punishing you but at the same time give the CEO millions for fucking up. Who in their right mind would ever play in a game like this? Lol, millions do.  Make no mistake. What the Fed does....what the short sellers do...the absolute destruction of assets is  ALL FOR THE PURPOSE OF SCARING YOU OUT OF YOUR POSITIONS. Once you sell, they've won.   We here posting tons of loss porn...memes to show an illustration of some aspect of Wall Street's shady side...discussions of how we view the markets and the world...it actually brings us closer together, but more importantly, shines a light of the reality of how this world works. We each have to find out place in it. Some of us will cry about how we were abused. Others of us will stay firm in our resolve to hold. Still others may lose their minds and sell. Whatever you do, just do it because YOU wanted to do it, not because somebody made you.  Personally, I am not scared. Why? Because it's only money. We say that a lot, but do we really understand the meaning of that phrase? It's only money. We won't take any of it with us after death. And I promise you, none of those wealthy 1% will take any of it either. In 2022, we are experiencing what I thought would never happen....a race to the bottom! These wealthy people have a lot more to lose than the little people of the world. I suggest you be brave and come what may....do not be scared.

124	1	For the past 78 years, the U.S has benefitted from being the issuer of the global reserve currency of the world. Commodity purchases are priced and settled using the dollar, meaning that the U.S has minimal exchange risk when purchasing goods around the world.  History suggests that this will not remain the case forever. In fact, most reserve currencies are only able to hold on to that title for about 100 years. In order to understand where the future is moving, I have often found it useful to study what has happened in the past.  Here is the history of how the dollar earned its status as the global reserve currency and the events that have transpired leading to today:  Until World War I, it was not clear that United States would emerge as a financial hegemon of the world. The crisis, which started in July of 1914, led to multiple European countries becoming indebted to the United States. By the time the U.S joined the war in 1916, the demand for dollars had surged across the world. The reason was simple - the U.S offered the most resources in terms of raw materials and industrial technology, two critical components of warfare.  The end of World War I marked the entrance of the U.S in designing the economic world order. Britain invited America to join in forgiving the debts of countries such as Russia, France, and Italy. The White House refused the offer. Instead, the U.S took a much more isolationist approach to foreign policy. Ultimately, France and Britain defaulted on their wartime American debt. The economic collapse from indebtedness also led countries such as Germany and Italy to fall under authoritarian leadership.  Post World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement aimed to remedy many of the issues. It wasn‚Äôt until the 1950s though that European economies were finally stable enough to transact with the U.S. Even then, it required Congress to pass the Marshall Plan in order to avoid collapse of European currencies. The geopolitical tension against the Soviet Union forced the west to become economic allies.  Most notably, the fixed rate exchange system of the world emerged during this time. It was clear that if the dollar was allowed to trade freely on a market, it would have had a downward slope, especially compared to other exporting competitors such as Japan and Germany. The world continued to abide by the newly created system, based on the anchor that the dollar was backed by gold.  In 1971, this came to an end. By the 60s, many countries had already started the process of cashing in their dollars for gold. Given that just $11 billion of gold backed almost $24 billion in dollar exchanges, the tension amongst other nations was clear. Eventually, President Richard Nixon was forced to end the convertibility of the dollar into gold in August of 1971, officially creating what is now known as the fiat money standard. The credibility of the dollar was no longer based on gold or other precious metals, but rather on the authority of the state.  The dollar became an instrument for speculation, and the biggest beneficiary of this was change was Wall Street itself. The depth of the financial markets had increased significantly, and dollar denominated international lending led to faster boom and bust cycles than ever before. Debt crises emerged in Latin America during the 80s, Mexico in 1995, Asia in 1997, and Russia in 1998.  The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was the last straw that stabilized the dollar as the dominant currency of the world. But with each crisis, the world questioned the credibility of U.S as a debtor. It appeared that Washington was following an aggressive policy of financial expansion and restructuring. Perhaps the most well known example of this was the bailout of LTCM, a hedge fund that blew up during the Russian Ruble crisis in 1998. (For people interested, I would highly recommend the book: ‚ÄúWhen Genius Failed‚Äù)  During the 2000s, the Euro emerged as a clear competitor to the dollar in Europe. In Asia, China‚Äôs cheap manufacturing costs challenged America‚Äôs ability to export international goods in the same way. Back home, U.S began to run on trade deficits, rather than surplus, as each administration seemed to care less and less about federal budgets.  The 2008 Financial Crisis brought these issues into the limelight once again. As banks collapsed around the world due to the interconnected nature of the financial system, economists and politicians questioned the structure laid out by Bretton Woods. In September of 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said ‚Äúwe must rethink the financial system from scratch, as at Bretton Woods".  In reality, however, the 2008 crisis signified the world‚Äôs dependence on America. The Federal Reserve pumped liquidity into the market and was able to protect the U.S balance sheet, but the same couldn‚Äôt be said about Europe. In fact, European government credit ratings were deteriorating faster than ever as the world was slowly losing faith in the Euro.  At the wake of the Coronavirus crisis in 2020, the financial system of the world came into question once again. Central banks around the world became accommodative and embarked on quantitative easing. Interest rates came down along with it, leading to a boom in prices across all asset classes. The Federal Reserve remained persistent on this path, claiming that inflation was transitory and mostly due to pandemic related supply disruptions. Despite this, the appetite for U.S treasuries remained strong.  In the late half of 2021, it became clear that inflation was not so transitory as Central Banks originally thought. In 2022, this became coupled with geopolitical tensions in Russia and Ukraine. As NATO countries shower Russia with sanctions and boot them off from the SHIFT payment system, the hegemony of the dollar comes into question once again today.  Money is now being used as a weapon more than ever before. It may be necessary for peaceful resolution of the situation at hand today, but it is without a doubt going to put a question mark on the reliability of fiat currency.  The Chinese Yuan is an obvious alternative to the dollar hegemony of the world today. The manufacturing prowess of China has become clear in the past decade, and China‚Äôs share of world GDP is expected to be about 20% by 2050. To some extent, this transition has already begun. On March 15, 2022 Saudi Arabia announced that it will now consider being paid in yuan instead of dollars for Chinese oil purchases. The lack of transparency of the Chinese government, however, make matters more complicated. Not many Central Banks would feel comfortable holding reserves of currencies from a censorship ridden government.  Many point to digital currency as a potential solution, citing that it is immutable on the blockchain and cannot be seized by governments. It is important to note, however, that most users today buy their digital currencies through centralized exchanges, which can just as easily be regulated. CBDCs, or Central Bank Digital Currencies, are another possibility. Both the U.S and China have expressed some interest around this concept, but given that these will be government-issued, there is doubt that the economics of it will any different than the fiat system today.  The reality is that war is the only modern model for the transition between reserve currencies. It was World War I and II that ultimately ended the British Empire‚Äôs dominance. Whether a peaceful transition is available this time around remains to be seen.

Saying how bears are fucked and that SPY is going to keep climbing up even though SPY historically corrects after failing to best its previous high more than 3 times.  You half wits honestly believed that meme stocks, some of which crashed 50-70% are going to recover and that we are "G0InG 2 dA m00N." Like seriously, are 99% of you new bloods literally that fucking retarded? You're seriously telling me that a company that is still losing money by triple digits million and getting fundamentally nowhere is going to magically recover after it's still overpriced by 70%? Where the fuck do you think it was going to climb back to? August 2021 levels?  Anyways, since you are all clearly a bunch of mentally handicapped dotes, I'm willing to bet 90% of you bought long term calls right when GME skyrocketed over 110 and AMC was trading above $17. In other words, right in the middle of a bull trap.

Any stocks to look into if banks begin to be banned from SWIFT? Does it even matter?  Personally I think it‚Äôll make the cost of doing business higher. Which is strange because energy and oil costs is a burden on the buyer.  From that rationale, oil and gas, uranium, and wheat will (all Russia exports) will be higher. I‚Äôm guessing the West leadership doesn‚Äôt care and SWIFT deactivation may seem pointless to the average joe.   In my thesis, it‚Äôs possible they don‚Äôt mind turning off Russian gas, but they don‚Äôt want to be seen doing it. Most likely they‚Äôll continue to make the cost of Russia exports balloon. Biden already said that the price we pay will be higher and that he‚Äôs looking into alternative sources.  SWIFT in my mind is a pseudo shut off. And regular citizens in Europe and US may not understand it. They‚Äôll blame Russia more than their own government.  So if Russia will already get the blame, i wonder if they‚Äôll just shut it off themselves.  I purchased Sentinelone just Incase Russia gets banned from SWIFT. Cybersecurity will be a hot topic.

151	1	Wait until VIX hits $15, and set a limit sell for $25. Typically, every 6-9 months, there's typically some sort of a crash (typically small), so you pretty much guarantee 20-120% roi a year, and If VIX does not hit $25 by 9 months time, move the limit to $18 - it typically hits that for smaller dips.

However I think they are gonna crush Q4's numbers and announce good guidance going forward. Inflation/higher interest won't affect them and an unstable global geopolitical situation would only benefit them.  Recently doubled down on leap calls as well:  https://www.wealthly.com/share/26JFEE  I guess I'm holding these bags all the way to WW3.
307	1	Silver and gold mining stocks could be a huge success and moon shot. With inflation picking up and putin Signaling he‚Äôs about to back the ruble with gold And with Jerome Powell saying that there is room for more than one global reserve currency that is not a good sign at all for the US dollar. Mining stocks Historically are much more volatile than gold and silver themselves so if gold and silver go up it‚Äôs gonna be a Lambo moonshot... Not to mention silver is the biggest concentrated short position of all time making GME an AMC look like a Sunday fucking picnic... oh and did I mention silver is the most patented most ductile most reflective most conductive metal there is and we‚Äôre running out of it and the current gold silver ratio is 78 to one while the historical average is 10 to one!
454	1	I first showed this [portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/) a year and a half ago, put together a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtmfkk/drydrink_portfolio_guide_to_leveraged_smartbeta/) on it and have provided updates every 4-6 months ([here's the last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sa51xh/leveraged_smartbeta_loss_porn_for_years/)). **TLDR**: here's a portfolio that requires little-to-no trading or time yet leaves boomer index funds way behind; a great default choice for WSB portfolios.  I am some times asked "Dry-Drink, aren't you going to get liquidated when markets drop?". For small corrections (ex: now), you just BTFD. That's why I was preemptively using less leverage (1.9-to-1) [during 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0hdra/leveraged_smartbeta_when_is_it_flairworthy_up/). So when the dip inevitably comes, I can take more losses and maybe even buy up more.  Today triggered my BTFD levels so I dumped \~$86K of borrowed money into boomer index funds:  &amp;#x200B;  [Orders went through today](https://preview.redd.it/5gg312hm2wj81.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfbdffced4a6631607f925229e634c3c1d5eb993)  &amp;#x200B;  [Positions](https://preview.redd.it/7r0wyted3wj81.png?width=1114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35ba38ff3d2c33756e7143c5d6ac01fe82fb2d21)  I'm hiding a couple of positions there that I don't want to show (they're both high-risk though, no fixed-income BS). What matters is the exposure, I got $1.54M + $404K worth of long exposures in an 831K account **(2.31-to-1 leverage)**.  So yeah, when the market recovers and I make an absolute killing, I don't want to hear you whine about how this portfolio is so dumb because I have only made money during bull runs. **I'm literally showing you, real-time, how to manage this thing during a correction, buy up when no one wants to, and position yourself for huge gains once the rebound (whether slow or fast) comes.**

825	0	I had a dream last night about the market going to crash, felt somehow like Michael Burry after waking up.  Anyways, I see the current situation is complicated and the market is highly volatile right now, fed is stuck with their monetary policy and will eventually stop QE and raise interest rates which will cause a lot of people to pull out their finger off their asses.  So I was wondering which Index contains the most overrated and overblown stocks with the highest PE ratios. I've to admit I'm too lazy to research this by myself, it's rather more logical and simple for me to ask random apes about this, nah fuck me.  So I got 40k and want to go yolo with Puts on some Index that's going to dump a lot. Any good hints?
166	1	To be clear, the signs of something on the scale of US petroleum self sufficiency would be seen coming years in advance, but with the ongoing conflicts in Russia, China, and Iran: people are pushing harder than ever to reduce and obsolete oil and gas use wherever possible in the USA, UK, and EU.  The people investing everything into oil now might see a big bump and then a huge rug-pull that wipes them out.  Sorry Mr. Buffet with your new 1.6 Bil double down!  You guys might want to follow him and sell as soon as he does.  Problem is, we need capacitors to make other forms of power work, and that means theres only one company in the USA that can make them:  UCAP Power.  Many of you recognize it as owner of Maxwell Technology after Elon Musk sold it back.  (Previously Tesla had a near monopoly on the industry).  There is a privately traded competitor for them in the EU with talks of going public, Skeleton Technologies.  In  laughable way, we are within an Energy Crisis within an Energy Crisis: and the total costs of all our power has only fallen until this day while efficiency has only risen.  ##TLDR:  1) Oil not as safe long investment as you think it is 2) Capacitors good

321	1	No doubt it is a tumultuous time filled with uncertainty for not only investors but the majority of the worlds populace. And as much as I‚Äôd love to give you degenerates great news I can only offer information that some maybe unaware of in order to navigate these waters a bit better.   First I‚Äôll address the war in Ukraine. Those that are hoping to make a play directly off the ruble and Russia I‚Äôll leave you with this excerpt as a multitude of Russian based companies are opening Chinese bank accounts in order to do business in Yuan.   "It's pretty simple logic. If you cannot use U.S. dollars, or euros, and U.S. and Europe stop selling you many products, you have no other options but to turn to China. The trend is inevitable," the source told Reuters.  As a growing number of Western companies abandon Russia, the willingness of emerging market giants such as China to sustain business relations with Moscow highlights a deep rift over Europe's biggest crisis since the World War Two. That trend could threaten to chip away the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. [Full Article](https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-russian-firms-rush-open-chinese-bank-accounts-sanctions-bite-sources-2022-03-03/)  And for themmins that think and argue war can boost economies? You‚Äôre right, to a very limited extent. In the immediate phases defense companies rake in dough, unemployment dips as more jobs are created for the effort and the GDP of countries involved seems to rise. The aspect most hawkish investors leave out though is that the countries involved print more fiat in order to facilitate all this and in turn make inflationary pressures worse for their people. [SAUCE](https://www.economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Economic-Consequences-of-War-on-US-Economy_0.pdf)  In conclusion, educate yourselves if you can read and don‚Äôt hype just bcuz shit is hype. If you only eat crayons and fling shit I‚Äôll attempt an emoji post for you at a later point.

268	1	&gt;The White House on Monday pushed back on concerns about the Biden administration‚Äôs willingness to cut deals with countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela as it looks for ways to blunt skyrocketing fuel prices in the United States.    &gt;   &gt; White House press secretary Jen Psaki faced multiple questions during Monday‚Äôs briefing on how the administration views these trade-offs of bartering with countries ‚Äúthat may have engaged in unsavory actions in the past,‚Äù as reports trickled out in recent days that President Joe Biden and European counterparts are discussing a ban on Russian oil imports to further punish President Vladimir Putin for his country‚Äôs attack on Ukraine.   &gt;   &gt;The Biden administration is in a tricky position as it faces bipartisan calls to ban Russian oil, a move that would upend markets in a global economy still recovering from the pandemic. As the White House weighs its next move, inflation tops the minds of Americans feeling the squeeze of rising prices, especially at the gas pump.   &gt;   &gt;U.S. officials met face-to-face with Venezuelan officials in Caracas over the weekend and discussed potentially easing oil sanctions on the country as part of the strategy to combat rising prices in the U.S. During Monday‚Äôs briefing, Psaki was asked about Venezuela‚Äôs leader and whether it was ‚Äúreally worth doing business with a despot like Nicol√°s Maduro to drive down gas prices.‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs leaping several stages ahead in any process,‚Äù Psaki said, adding that oil was just one element of the discussions. ‚ÄúAt this point in time, I don‚Äôt have anything to predict. It‚Äôs ongoing.‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;Psaki said that while energy security was a key part of the meetings in Venezuela, U.S. officials also discussed the welfare of detained U.S. citizens. She had a similar message on negotiations in Saudi Arabia and Iran, noting that the talks were in progress and that energy was just one piece of the multipronged discussions.  TL:DR version: US is like "yeah we've been sanctioning you hard for like forever man, but times have changed man, can you spare some oil like c'mon man"  Source: [https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/07/white-house-oil-deals-saudi-arabia-venezuela-iran-00014803](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/07/white-house-oil-deals-saudi-arabia-venezuela-iran-00014803)

278	0	At this time my EV investment is severely down and too are ALL EV stocks, but i think that even with current world events that I can stick with company value and have to look at a longer time frame. There are many American EV made cars based in the US, and part supply will change to align with the government's pressure of made in the USA anyway. Many EV companies don't just make cars, they have battery and other techs to offer. Ford and GM have spent $Bs retooling, we're not going back now. My conspiracy mind tends to believe the purposeful downward market pressure makes it the right time and price for auto dealers to put in their orders. As oil prices rise so will the pressure to not use it. The Putin conflict just maybe the catalyst for a new world order of EV cars and major emissions reduction? üôå  What do you think?
612	1	According to securities documents released on Monday, seven large pension funds, including CalPERS, the largest pension fund in the United States, bought shares of rivian, an electric vehicle start-up, in the quarter ended December 31.  According to whalewisdom, a fund tracker, the seven pension funds include the teacher retirement system of Texas, CalPERS, Maryland State retirement and pension system, Utah, Colorado Pension funds in North Carolina and Wisconsin.  Among them, the California Civil Service Pension Fund (CalPERS) manages about $492 billion in assets and is the largest pension fund in the United States. According to the announcement, the fund purchased more than 305000 rivian shares. If the closing price of rivian at the end of last year is US $103.69, it is equivalent to a market value of about US $32 million.  The $191 billion Texas teacher retirement system of Texas fund holds about 33000 shares of the company.  These measures show that the risk appetite of pension funds, which have always been biased towards soundness, has increased. This may be because these pension funds still face a funding gap - although US stocks have been on an upward trend since the outbreak of the new crown, according to the global sovereign wealth fund, a data platform for large buyer institutions, overall, the average capital adequacy ratio (a measure of assets and liabilities) of US pension plans is still less than 75%.  It is worth noting that the well-known institutions that bought rivian are not just pension funds. A report released last week showed that several well-known investors, including billionaire George Soros and hedge fund tiger Global Fund, increased their holdings of the company's shares in the last quarter.  Rivian's share price rose more than 12% on Monday and narrowed to 6% at the end of the day.  Taking advantage of the trend of electric vehicles, rivian became the star enterprise in the wave of US stock IPOs last year. At the end of last year, its IPO raised US $12 billion, becoming the largest financing project of US stocks last year.  However, rivian's share price performance has not been ideal since its listing. As of Friday's close, rivian's share price has fallen 43% so far this year. As of Monday's close, the company's share price closed at $62.65, still about 64% lower than the high of $179.46 on November 16 last year.
476	0	 I've seen people relying pretty heavily upon CNN's Fear and Greed Index, which is an attempt at quantifying how fearful or greedy traders are. The general idea is that you want to be greedy when others are fearful, and vis-a-versa.  I thought I could do a better job than them by just using WallStreetBets discussion data, so I built my own metric to quantify the overall sentiment of the sub.  [Here's a link](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/sz6grd/wallstreetbets_fear_and_greed_index/)¬†to a dashboard I built showing the current value of the index, and its movement over time. WSB has tended to fall on the "greedier" side of the index for the past few years, although there have been several periods in which sentiment has dipped (including over the past few days.)

Their store received orders on Friday from corporate to literally scan every single piece of inventory in the store.  Literally everything. Not one department or key items but everything.  This comes after a few days of noticing that half the things in the store were scanning wrong prices. (My kiddos words.)  It‚Äôs not just my kids store, it is every store.  Hack? Server failure? No clue.  Whatever it is this is the time of year when Target has cut their staffing hours drastically to up profitability in the quarter. The ‚Äúget this done asap‚Äù nature of the directive is seemingly in conflict with that.  Thoughts? Anyone heard anything similar?
401	1	The US used SWIFT sanctions back in 2014 against Russia. It only affected 2 of their banks at the time but it restricted Visa and Mastercard from doing any transactions with Russian citizens.   This is not an energy post. I firmly believe we can not sanction Russian energy.....but that's for a different conversation.  Now with the population of Russia being 144 million or so, and assuming only 50% (conservative estimates) hold a Visa and/or Mastercard , is it safe to assume that the short term implications on these companies would be severely compromised?   Add to it the state of inflation and current economic status among several people worldwide. Do not underestimate the ego of Americans when it comes to status. For the the past 2 years money has been flowing like piss on an fetish whore's face. As a country known for our ridiculous indulgence, I think it's safe to say that not only will these SWIFT sanctions hurt these companies,  but the almost certain delinquencies from Amercians now either out of stimulus money and/or rising inflation would likely lead to accelerated percentage of charge offs.     No positions yet, just discussion.  Considering  May 20, 200p for  Visa

885	0	Bears are pretty cool animals and they do something that's very unique: they hibernate! Have you ever wondered how bear hibernation works? Here are 7 fun facts you can share with friends.  1. Right before they hibernate, bears load up on food, eating up to 20,000 calories daily and gaining as much as 30 pounds a week.¬† 2. Bears mate in the late spring/early summer and the fertilized egg will undergo delayed development and remain in a female bear's womb for weeks or months. If she hasn't accumulated enough fat by hibernation time, the egg will spontaneously abort.¬† 3. Baby bears are born in winter during hibernation and are nursed in the den until they emerge in spring. 4. During hibernation a bear's heart rate drops to as slow as 8 beats per minute. 5. Bears sleep in dens they dig out in hollowed-out tree cavities, under logs or rocks, caves, banks and shallow depressions. 6. Bears hibernate without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating. 7. When they emerge, they are in a state called walking hibernation for 2-3 weeks while their metabolic processes adjust to normal levels and they do not eat or drink much during this time.
658	0	Salutations, Fellow Austists!   Rejoice with me! This year my wife's boyfriend has granted me a special privilege: I get to pick our yearly Family Vacation! And instead of going to some boring place to see some cliche thing, you know, like the Blue Man Group or Yellowstone National Park, this year I'm taking our family to enjoy something that's truly magical. I'm taking us to where the \*REAL\* action is, to a can't-miss experience that bonds true spirits closer together, for life.     I'm so excited, my dudes! Where are we going?  To a show like no other.  We're going to see a show on the Fed Rate Hike Spring Tour!  Now, this is a 1st for our family.  We'll probably go early to get good seats.  Go down in front to the pit.  I want to be there the moment JPow takes the stage.  We're hoping to go, down a few cheap beers, and watch his dazzling laser light show, craning our necks up at interest rates shooting upwards towards the Heavens, watching JPow's mesmerizing movements as he makes markets explode back down to Earth with fire and without giving a fuck.  My God.  So fucking Metal.  Feeling the powerful bass of the Fed's sick financial bass drops and face-melting policy breakdowns as we mosh hard all night long.  I can't wait.  I'm hoping JPow or the lead guitarist crowd surfs on top of us.  I'm hoping their set includes the best songs from their latest album: "It's Just Transitory" and "The Economy Is Strong".  But please I need your help! : (  After countless hours scouring the net and fb I just can't seem to find the tour dates. Or just where and when the first show is? The 1st 50+ bps hike?  You'd think MGK would be posting something about this on IG.  Please, I can't let my wife's boyfriend down.  We're so looking forward to this.  I've been growing my hair and beard out for month for this, so that I can head-bang sweaty all night long. Also because I can no longer afford barbers.  I can't even seem to find a link to where they'll be live-streaming the much-anticipated first show. A show that's going to be as legendary as Queen playing Live Aid--mark my fucking words, fans.  This is important and we want to be a part of history-in-the-making.    In a nutshell, where can I score ticks?  Preferably with good seats.  I've been using my wife's boyfriend's credit card because all of my Wendy's paycheck is tied-up in fast-expiring Calls.  I've been obsessively checking Ticketmaster, CVent, and Live Nation every morning, every night for weeks.  Please tell me I didn't miss pre-sales!  I'm planning on bringing my SPCE certificate that's -80% from ATH and a sharpie to get JPow to autograph it for me.  I'll frame it and hang it up in my room in the basement so it will finally have some value again.  And I hear tell that Cramer may be opening?  Can anyone confirm? I'd love for him and his crew to autograph the margin call notice I received from TDAmeritrade after following his investment advice.  So if anyone bought tickets please let me know where. Or let me know if all are sold-out and where we can stream the hike online.  If we can go and you chip-in for gas we're also open to carpool to the show day-of. We can hold about 2-3 more in our 2009 Dodge Grand Caravan.  Must be willing to listen to Kelly Clarkson on the way.  Thanks in advance and rock on my dudes \\00/
535	1	   How does everyone feel about SOFI calls heading into their March 3rd earnings? I feel as if a massive growth into 13-14$ is likely‚Ä¶the super bowl was hosted in SoFi Stadium, I couldn‚Äôt have been the only person that saw that and went wow SoFi has a football stadium? Turns out they do.     So that I feel brought forth more customers, amongst other things SoFi is becoming more reputable as a source and overall more popular, it seems to becoming solidified as a true money lending option compared to banks as it seems to be both friendlier and less expensive tax and interest wise.     However, these earnings are for Q4 of 2021, so, here‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking, if SoFi is gaining traction, I feel a real deal price would be 16-18$, a growth into 13-14$ for Q4 2021 earnings seems like a solid bet into an eventual 16-18$ into Q1 2022 earnings, SoFi seems heavily undervalued and looking at call interest relative to put interest 12-15$ calls for march 4th and 11th are becoming highly sought after, plan? 13.5 calls for march 4th 2022 Position- 10, 13.5 calls for March 4th, 2022  I am known for my chart readings, if you have followed me you know I have predicted and made a hefty gain on  CPB chart, ZNGA chart, BBIG chart, TSN chart. I am 4/5 correct, failing on BNGO as I believed manipulation would go the opposite way. My belief is SoFi will reach 13$ by March 4th because of the crown chart. Noted in this image you will see the three prongs that form the crown, the rim of the crown, the chart leading up to prong action, has a 3 month average, March brings it into the 3rd month for the down trend rim, however, if you notice the trend, it has a monthly high low and with earnings being released the new high low I believe will be in the 12-13$ range, with SoFi being a hyped stock this final new high low ending the crown pattern should fall higher than expected. Essentially meaning these call contracts would be mini lottery plays making at least 40% gain in my opinion .[SoFi is Crowned as King](https://imgur.com/a/iQVwOm7)

Chart movements indicated that the FUD caused by the Russo-Ukrainian War has levelled out since investors who YOLO'd into gold now can sell them at a good profit and buy dips in the market. The COVID FUD has already passed, so that's out of the question.  Based on TA, the main trigger of the Bull Market is me selling all my fucking stocks last Friday at a massive loss since my weak ass can't take this shit no more. If I had to describe my entire history of toying with stocks, it's basically a Bizonacci video.  So yeah, I sold all my stocks, so expect a massive bull run for a few months to come.

Well guess what? Now is the time to be buying. Netflix drops from the 600s to the 300s and you don't buy. Tesla enters the 700s and you don't buy. Amd went under 100 and you didn't buy.  Dude stop telling me the market is rigged. You're just too scared to buy and hold onto anything. Just don't buy garbage companies like wish and you'll be fine.   The problem is you guys feel this illogical need to own stocks that will like 2x expectations every quarter, which leads to these insane swings like FB and Netflix. In the real world, not every quarter and not every year is a home run. I think a lot of companies are on sale. I think a lot will bounce back. And I think a lot of you are about to miss the coming bull run over the next few months because you have paper hands like Meet Klevin.

M√∏ller ‚Äì M√¶rsk A/S (pronounced [Àà…õÀÄ Ààp ∞eÃùÀÄ m√∏l…êÀàm…õ…êÃØsk]), also known simply as Maersk (/m…õ…ôrsk/),[4] is a Danish shipping company, active in ocean and inland freight transportation and associated services, such as supply chain management and port operation.[5] Maersk has been the largest container shipping line and vessel operator in the world since 1996. The company is based in Copenhagen, Denmark, with subsidiaries and offices across 130 countries and around 83,000 employees worldwide in 2020.  So now why buy?  1. Shipping is and will always be in high demand and will not die out unless Musk can replace Maersk with his name by inventing a teleport machine that can move tonnes of shit from Asia to Europe in a split sec.  2. When you go to some of the busiest ports in the US, you will notice that the name Maersk is on at least fucking 60% of all containers, the rest being Yang Ming, Cosco, Hapag-Lloyd, ONE etc. and shit.  3. Maersk, which was already on track for record profits, the largest ever for any Danish company, increased its profit forecast ($24B) by nearly five percent and free cash flow ($16.4B) from operations by more than 13 percent. Also note that the company is not based in a shitty part of Europe like Montenegro or Ukraine or whatever. That matters a lot.

In the other half of my options portfolio I have been playing $SPY put options to capitalize on the current downtrend, however last week when Canada upped their rates the Toronto Stock Exchange has seen some gains even as SPY has been falling. I exited my SPY position because I realized it could easily reverse rather than crash with the increased expectation of currency stability with FED action. Obviously though I am torn and still want to play the decline, I‚Äôm just not sure that the SPY will cooperate. Ultimately leaving my investment success in the hands of the FED is frustrating.     So here I am with a handful of cash from the supply chain issues stemming this time from global conflict instead of quarantine and another handful from the decline in value of equities in the S&amp;P500, and it is obvious what the play is to capitalize on both ongoing situations.     BlackRock makes the vast majority of its revenue from fees it charges based on the value of its assets under management. As their AUM shrinks, so does its revenue. BlackRock has also earned itself a reputation with investing in companies the US does not approve of abroad as they have poured money into China especially in the last few years as they have bought up cheap assets effected by the Evergrande crisis in China. With a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, or financial alliance with Russia or any other threat even perceived that the Chinese economy might be effected similarly to Russia‚Äôs since the invasion of Ukraine, BlackRocks assets could take an additional massive hit. Also BlackRock will have no choice but to watch these assets disappear because no one is going to buy them if they even are allowed by their governments to.     All this to say I have and am still purchasing put options on BlackRock for when these next wave of supply issues are really being felt and BlackRock suffering hard as their domestic and foreign assets shrink substantially in value. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be shocked to see BlackRock crisis being the face of the ‚ÄúBig One‚Äù this time.  BLK Apr 14 $630puts

It thought me the nature of the stock market in the most fun and retarded way‚Ä¶   I understand the mods that this is the correct way for future growth and a more comprehensive way to engage in the market by reducing and restricting memes‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôll never forget the memes during the AMC phase. Including the chicken sacrifice for black berry (South Park meme)   I‚Äôm going to trust the mods that they know best and that they met half way in the middle between good DD and excessive memes by us retarded apes.  Good DD does get lost in the fun of the memes‚Ä¶and I also understand that the OGs from the early days of WSB come from that there is good Information that is being over looked by the low effort meme.   I saw a comment from visual mod earlier today explaining the move and it seems well thought out and ultimately it should help in the long run for us to be better and more prepared and also more equipped to be in a better position to engage in the market to actually make tendies in a unified sub. - destroy hedges   And there‚Äôs also the benefit it should root out the low effort post‚Ä¶ which sucksssss asss  But man it brought me so much joy to pull up to this sub and see FUN memes   So to my fellow retarded apes   I‚Äôm with the mods on this one. They restricted but not eliminated the memes.  Loss and gain post is still available - with also good DD post - and original content memes is the right move.

Need someone that really knows about stocks, dividends, interest, etc . As far as net investment income tax, I believe if you go over the MAGI, you only get taxed over that with 3.8% but not 100% sure. So I think you get taxed at your regular rate + 3.8% over the MAGI.

Claims abound that this sub is past its glory days, populated by shills and apes who have lost sight of its glorious purpose‚Ä¶ insane risks and insane rewards. I‚Äôm here to suggest a means to prove all the naysayers wrong.  Privateer gang.  No rusty and barely seaworthy glorified barge this, but as many yachts, speedboats, and small craft can be outfitted with small arms and submitted to the Ukrainian Ministry of defense for Letters of Marque, for use in the war against Russia. ‚ÄúWhats this?‚Äù I hear you saying. ‚ÄúThe Russian Navy would tear us to shreds!‚Äù   Indeed they would. However, Russian flagged cargo ships, personal craft, and tankers? Thats another story entirely. If handfuls of somalian pirates in sinking deathtraps  can do it, imagine what tens of thousands of demented autists chasing profits on the high seas would be able to achieve. The risk is high, yes‚Ä¶ but the reward? Ten baggers galore, tendies raining from the heavens, and the eternal gratitude of the girlfriends, wives, and boyfriends of Ukraine. The best part? It would be entirely legal.

The Ukraine invasion has prompted Western car makers, luxury-good purveyors and other companies to leave Russia. Makers of drugs, vaccines and medical equipment continue to do business, however, saying they have an ethical responsibility, though some drug and device firms have spoken out against the invasion and scaled back operations.  &gt;‚ÄúIf our products don‚Äôt get to the patients in need, people will die or have severe consequences,‚Äù Johnson &amp; Johnson Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said at an investor conference Tuesday.     *Johnson &amp; Johnson*, which sells drugs and medical devices, plans to continue to provide what it said are essential products to Russia. Drug distributor *AmerisourceBergen* *Corp*. said it has stopped doing new business in Russia, though it will keep distributing certain cancer drugs and finish clinical trials.     *Bayer* *AG‚Äôs* drug and crop divisions are still operating in Russia. Withdrawing seeds, pesticides and other products, a company spokesman said, would exacerbate food shortages arising from the conflict due to the important role of Ukraine and Russia in the global wheat supply.  &gt;‚ÄúA suspension of deliveries for cancer or cardiovascular patients would not be ethically justifiable and would heavily impact the civilian population of Russia,‚Äù the spokesman said.     Russia isn‚Äôt a big market for Western healthcare companies. Sales in the country account for less than 2% of the companies‚Äô world-wide total, according to analysts and companies. Russia imported about $700 million in U.S. pharmaceutical products last year, according to S&amp;P Global Inc.‚Äôs market intelligence unit.  &gt;Some 80% to 85% of Russian-made drugs, however, depend on imported ingredients, according to RNC Pharma, a Moscow-based market research company. Russian pharmaceutical companies are struggling to import the main ingredients, said Pavel Rasshchupkin, RNC‚Äôs commercial director. Medicines haven‚Äôt gone into shortages so far, but the devaluation of the ruble has driven up prices, Mr. Rasshchupkin said. Pharmacies are seeing panic buying, he said.     *Merck* *&amp; Co.*, *Pfizer* *Inc.* and *Bristol Myers Squibb* *Co.* , which have continued most activities in Russia, are among drugmakers that say they have paused enrollment in clinical trials in the country.     *GlaxoSmithKline* *PLC* said it wouldn‚Äôt enter into any contracts that support the Russian administration or military, such as agreements to supply vaccines for military immunization drives, a spokeswoman said. *Royal Philips* *NV* has stopped selling consumer products like electric toothbrushes in Russia, but continues to supply medical equipment, a spokesman said.     *By* *Denise Roland* *,* *Jared S.

WW3 starts and i start to average into Russian ETF's only to find out you idiots are doing the same thing as me. Now it's basically a certainty I lose all my money.   I thought even you apes were smart enough to know better then to catch falling knives in a country you know nothing about, with a currency that is rapidly becoming worthless. Oh boy I was wrong.   I'm starting to realise this Sub isn't about trying to make money/lose money or form coherent investment plans. Rather it's about Chasing the most volitile investments possible on publicly traded markets so that you can post memes about it later.   You make money and you're the brainiac that navigated the most turbulent markets in history and won. You lose money and you post your loss porn here for internet points. It's literally a win win situation.   The more you idiots keep buying Russian stocks the lower they will go somehow. Give it 10 years and these stocks will still be worth nothing because the currency they are valued in is basically worthless.   This is exactly why I'm averaging into them bit by bit.

286	1	Positioned in the next quarter to out perform the earning of its two largest competitors, VZ has a team of executives that are uniquely talented in the communication industry. Already the 5g rollout is pushing profits upwards, and as technology continues to inovate, the upward trend will steepen.  Ok, most people have stopped reading, so I'll just post a copy paste from wikipedia so my post isn't too short. Obviously the 2 word title is sufficient. In 1984, the United States Department of Justice mandated AT&amp;T Corporation to break up the Bell System into seven companies, each a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), commonly referred to as "Baby Bells". Bell Atlantic,[11] one of the Baby Bells, came into existence the same year. Headquartered in Philadelphia, it became the parent of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and the C&amp;P Telephone companies, with a trading area from New Jersey to Virginia.  As part of a rebranding of the Baby Bells in the mid-1990s, all of Bell Atlantic's operating companies assumed the holding company's name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. While Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City. In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving entity, changed its name to Verizon, a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for "truth") and horizon.[12]  In 2015, Verizon expanded into content ownership by acquiring AOL,[13][14] and two years later, it acquired Yahoo!.[15] AOL and Yahoo were amalgamated into a new division named Oath Inc.,[16] which was rebranded as Verizon Media in January 2019, and was spun off and rebranded to Yahoo! after its sale to Apollo Global Management.  As of 2016, Verizon is one of three remaining companies with roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. SBC Communications bought the Bells' former parent AT&amp;T Corporation and took on the AT&amp;T name, and CenturyLink acquired Qwest (formerly US West) in 2011 and later became Lumen Technologies in 2020.  Verizon's mobile network is the largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 120.9 million subscribers as of the end of Q4 2020.[17] And as of 2017, Verizon is the only publicly traded telecommunications company that has two stock listings in its home country, both the NYSE (principal) and NASDAQ (secondary).[18] As of 2017, it is also the second largest telecommunications company by revenue after AT&amp;T.  30 day calls at 66.06 per share is the play.
776	1	I'm here to make sure you don't have a good night of sleep for the next several months. Macro economists like "David Hunter" have made bold predictions that we're going to see a parabolic melt up to SPX $6,000 at the end of this bull market run, and I'm here to tell you why that not only won't happen, but that we're about to see SPY, QQQ,  IWM enter a bear market.  &amp;#x200B;  First, we need to understand an assumption about the money supply. That is, there is NO money on the "sidelines"  For example:  If I hold cash in my bank account, that money is lent out to others from the bank which is exchanged for goods and services. That exchange of cash deposited in another's bank account which may then be used to purchase stocks, bonds, etc. The other party receives cash and places it in their bank account. (cycle repeats)    If we can assume that all of the money is *fully invested* (see assumption above), then what matters is the *"composition of assets."*  We see this happen already when money flows from one sector to the next. It can also happen between asset classes, like stocks to bonds or vice-versa. Over the last decade, it has been a free-for-all search for yield. The FED keeping rates near 0.00% has influenced investors to purchase risk assets like equities, trading cards, jpegs, leveraged ETF's, &amp; other dogshit (and sometimes on margin). The point being, cash has been trash, bonds don't provide much % interest, and the only way to grow wealth was to yolo your whole account in meme stocks.  Now that the FED has decided to shut off liquidity and begin rate hikes, there will be a huge shift in the *composition of assets* (not to mention, the money supply stopping/potentially reversing if the FED rolls off their balance sheet = growth in $SPX is gone). Safer assets like bonds/treasuries will have a higher % return with a lower cost of capital than growth stocks. Money will rotate from these risk assets to safer\* assets. It's not a question of "if", but a question of "when", and with valuations so high, you'd think its probably sooner rather than later? Who wants to be left holding the jpeg bags?   This process will have a negative impact on the overall equity market, but it will more than likely destroy 0% returning assets, growth stocks, memes, dogshit companies, etc.   Some may counter this viewpoint with: "The Economy and company earnings are the best they've ever been!" to which I would say, if a company is setting record profits today, is it more or less likely to post record profits next quarter?  If you don't believe me yet, think about how $120/bn month was printed since the Covid Crash Bottom and where we are now. Ask yourself, what happens when the FED isn't IN the market propping it up?  tldr;  JPOW is the boogeyman that lives under bull's mattresses. The stock market is not the economy. Gay bears will walk the earth again.

Lois Frankel on January 12th (-10.2% in two weeks) 5. Purchase of Broadcom ($AVGO) by Rep.

If a bunch of us just chip in a little bit we could send this flying and could profit greatly!

This means that from 20 March onwards no employee will be allowed to return for work.  For those who have been sleeping all this time, the union recently voted 97% in favor to strike because they can't get any deal on wages &amp; pensions. The CP employer has refused all their demands and despite weeks of negotiations they've gone nowhere. The union was about to announce a strike today (needs 72hr notice as well) but the employer got there first announcing a lock out.   What is the difference? A lockout allows more flex to the employer as they don't have allow employees to return to work - ever - unless a new contract is signed.   **The impact of this cannot be overestimated. CP is responsible for bringing virtually all the fertilizer, grain and whatnot from Canada to USA, both for USA consumption and to be exported abroad.** USA has no reserves of whatever the railway brings.

571	1	TL;DR  \- Earnings March 3rd  \- More than 70% of revenue comes from paid subscriptions  \- Have you used the app before?  If so, do you still use it?  \- Duolingo is not sticky enough for long-term subscription growth  \- Passive-aggressive owl  \- Puts go brrrrrrr  Positions:   \- 18MAR22 80P x 5  &amp;#x200B;  I'll start by saying this is nothing against Duolingo's software, which I actually really like.  It's about Duolingo's prospects as a long-term high-growth investment.  Here are 5 reasons I think Duolingo is a solid bearish earnings play:  1. Stickiness: Duolingo has more than 500 million downloads, which means at least some of you degenerates must have downloaded it at some point.  For those who did, do you still use it?  Didn't think so.   2. Subscription model: &gt;70% of Duolingo's income comes from subscriptions.  My first reaction to this was, who the hell is paying for Duolingo when the free version works just fine?  But more objectively, there are two possible outcomes for a Duolingo subscriber: either they give up trying to learn the language and cancel their subscription, or they successfully learn the language and cancel their subscription.  Unlike for example a paid subscription streaming service, there is no reason to pay for Duolingo indefinitely.   3. Guidance: I expect this earnings report will have FY2022 guidance.  Their Q3 results blew past the Q3 guidance they had just given in Q2.  I'd bet Q4 results also surpass the Q4 guidance from Q3.  But what this means is that they'll need to be reasonably conservative in their FY2022 guidance so that the actual numbers have a decent chance of surpassing it, particularly if my guess is right that they have fairly high attrition.  Tepid guidance has been destroying growth companies this earnings season. 4. Share price: Yes the shares, at $93 closing price today, are well off their high of $205.  But they are only &lt;10% off their IPO price from last summer of $102.  And they've traded largely sideways for the last two months while many other tech stocks have tanked.  There is still room to fall. 5. Passive-aggressive owl: Seriously, fuck that guy.  And just to preemptively address a couple of counterpoints:  "Nice of you to make this argument when stock is already down &gt;50% ATH".  So are plenty of tech stocks.  What's the point of this argument, that it can't go down any further?  It, and any other stock, can still drop 100% from the current price.  "With global travel reopening, people will be looking to learn a new language for an upcoming trip/move".  Maybe?  But if anything, Duolingo had a big surge in monthly users when covid started.  The 'self-improvement' drive has really worn off since then (or maybe that's just me?).  Plus people who travel will have no incentive to keep up the language training after their trip, and people who move will learn the language a lot more from being immersed in it than they will from an app, and will eventually stop using the app entirely.  "Not enough graphs/lines/crayons".  Got me there.  "I'm actually learning Estonian right now to impress my wife's boyfriend".  Fair enough, but let's be honest - if you had $12.99, you wouldn't be spending it on a monthly Duolingo subscription.  This is just my take and is not financial advice.

The armed forces value intelligence, critical thinking and decision making skills to operate the war machines, so most of you are safe. They do not rely on thousands of ground troops armed with fancy 22's.  So sit back, relax, buy the dip and your 0dte spy calls and don't worry about it.
90	1	I posted in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t3kmaf/spliffmaster489s_crash_course_in_economics_and/) about market mechanics of the S&amp;P500.  I think with the recent rally in mind we should review [THIS SQUEEZE METRICS PAPER](https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf) and talk about why we should look to btfd (buy the fucking dip) after these big down moves.  I'm going to go page by page and try to explain the concepts inside it.  Before you read this post you will need to have a firm knowledge on what the options greeks are and why they are important.  I will try to explain some concepts but I might gloss over others.  If you want to learn more watch [this video about options greeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXZIW161ryI).    &amp;#x200B;  Page 1:   The paragraph starting with "options are best known for their non-linear payoff"  Despite what the moron 19 year olds on this sub think, options market makers just fill orders that come through.  THAT IS BASICALLY IT.  Now lets say you are a big dog manager at an options market maker firm and you have a big ass portfolio filled with millions of options contracts.  What are you going to do to limit your risk?  Of course you have to do something, you can't just keep taking the other side of trades and hope you make money.  The trick is to hedge your options by buying or selling the underlying stock to make your position "neutral".   This is where delta comes in.  Delta is how much your option will increase if the underlying increases.  For example, if you own a 440 SPY call with 50 deltas then your call will go up 50 dollars if SPY goes up 1 dollar.  Thus if we want to neutralize our position then we need to short 50 shares.  This is because if SPY goes up one dollar from 440 to 441 then we gain 50 dollars from the call.  However, we lose 50 dollars from our short 50 shares position.  Hence we neither gained nor lost any money during this move (it's more complicated than this be we will talk about gamma and vanna later).  A rule of thumb to keep in mind is that you need to short as many shares as you have deltas to be flat delta.   Puts have negative delta because if the underlying goes up in price then you lose money.  If you want to hedge a put then you buy shares until you have 0 delta.  This is what the market makers do to ensure that they have minimal risk.  Their massive options protfolios are a jumbled mess of all kinds of complex options orders with crazy deltas and they have algos buying and shorting shares as appropriate to ensure that they are delta flat.  THIS CONSTANT BUYING AND SELLING FROM ROBOTS IS WHAT CAN INFLUENCE THE MARKET.  I, of course, do not claim that some nefarious algo is out there trying to shake you out of your dog shit 400 SPY puts that just got blown the fuck out of the water.  I simply claim that these robots must hedge their positions by trading the underlying so that their portfolios can survive.  This type of hedging is called "dynamic hedging".  Page 2:  Now that we know how algos hedge their options the question is how do we make a profit off this knowledge.  Right now it doesn't seem that obvious but there are some reasonable assumptions that we can make to get the ball rolling.  The first comes from the fact that the options dealers' biggest customers are pension funds.  These funds need to protect their massive S&amp;P holdings so they will buy puts for protection.  They also want to make some extra money off of their assets so they will sell covered calls.  The options dealers are on the other side of this trade so they will be long calls and short puts.    Now we need to start talking about gamma and it influences the algos' trading.    Another way to think about delta is that it is roughly the probability that your option will be worth something at expiration.  So an at the money option should have a delta of about 50 because it is basically a coin toss on if it's going up or down.  However, if the market moves in a way that is favorable towards your position then the probability that your option will be in the money should be higher.  Hence the delta should also be higher.  This phenomena is gamma.  Gamma is the increase in the delta of your option when the underlying increases.  This is an issue for the market making algos because whenever the underlying moves they have to rehedge their position.  For example, if I buy a 50 delta call with 2 gamma then I will go short 50 shares to hedge.  Now the underlying goes up a dollar and I now have a 52 delta call (50 delta + 2 gamma) and I am short 50 shares.  I now need to short an additional 2 shares to stay neutral.  In this example we see that staying neutral is an active process that requires constant participation in the market.    If you are still confused about how these options are hedged you can look at a more in depth explanation on page 3 of that squeeze metrics paper.    In the next post I will explain how this active hedging impacts liquidity and influences the market.

440	1	With Putin going full WSB and destroying this own economy, the whole world is stressed out. You known what reliefs stress? A nice little cigarette on the balcony maybe a left handed cig every once in a while. Anyways, soldiers love to smoke cigs every fucking war movie has dudes straight chiefing on cancer sticks. The world consumption of nicotine products is going to excel because of another potential war in Europe. Not everyone has the luxury of  ripping a Juul in a bathroom, especially on the battlefield. A cig is a much better, more efficient form of consuming the nectar of the gods, nicotine.   I hate it to admit it but I have a terrible nicotine addiction, but this is how it stops. No more vapes, I've wasted so much money on these robot cocks that I could have just wasted taking WSB plays. If you've never ripped a Pi√±a colada Breeze, go buy one they murk. BUT I'm officially a cig guy and will only consuming them with black and milds as my source of nicotine.   Quit buying wasting your money on a $30 disposable vape you retard. Smoke a cig and buy tobacco stonks.

45	1	The modified repurchase program will be effective for two years through March 2024   Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -4.35% boosted its share buyback program to $25 billion from $15 billion, in a bid to reassure investors about the company‚Äôs prospects after a year in which its stock has fallen by more than half.  The potential buybacks are substantial compared with the Chinese e-commerce giant‚Äôs market value: As of Monday, it had a market capitalization of about $270 billion, according to FactSet.  The modified repurchase program will be effective for two years through March 2024, Alibaba BABA -4.35% said on Tuesday morning Hong Kong time. It said the 67% increase in the firepower allocated for buybacks was ‚Äúa sign of confidence about the company‚Äôs continued growth in the future.‚Äù  Chinese technology stocks in Hong Kong, China and in the U.S.‚Äîwhere they are listed as American depositary receipts‚Äîhave been highly volatile recently amid worries that U.S. regulators may move to delist Chinese companies as soon as 2024 and signs that Beijing‚Äôs long-running regulatory crackdown will continue.   Alibaba‚Äôs New York Stock Exchange-listed ADRs are down nearly 13% so far this year‚Äîand have fallen about 57% over the past 12 months‚Äîaccording to FactSet. Its stock also trades in Hong Kong, where shares rose about 4% in early trading on Tuesday.  Alibaba said it repurchased about $9.2 billion worth of ADRs as of March 18 under its previous program.  Separately, the company said Weijian Shan, executive chairman of investment group PAG, would join the board as an independent director starting March 31. Ericsson Chief Executive B√∂rje Ekholm, who has served on the board since 2015, will step down the same day, Alibaba said.
715	0	Sorry if this shouldn‚Äôt be its own post but it‚Äôs been bothering me. I used to come here for the lulz and it was great fun, but it started to get old and destructive behavior became more common. Yeah I get it, it‚Äôs the schtick in this sub, but that doesn‚Äôt make it okay.  Seeing posts of people yolo-ing and losing their life savings might seem funny on the surface, but then I think how many of these people are literally ruining their lives. And then instead of showing compassion or support, commenters just pile on and make it worse.  I came across a Twitter profile today of someone asking for help because they lost their life savings. I‚Äôd post a link if it weren‚Äôt against the rules, but it is so sad reading how he needs help to take care of his family. I threw him a few bucks but it‚Äôs not going to fix their problems.  It‚Äôs just really hard to see and this sub encourages too many destructive behaviors. I‚Äôd simply ask that more people start showing more empathy and compassion, even if it doesn‚Äôt get you as much karma. My two cents.

Shut the fuck up and do your trades. If you really need a NATO summit to tell you whether you should buy a stock or not you deserve losing all and hanging yourself.  Newsflash, the stock market never made sense nor will it. Best you can do is trade shit you know about and feel still hasn't been spotted by the bandwagon of smooth brains on subreddits like this one or r/stocks . Or alternatively manipulate the market like the rich investors you look up to do. Warren Buffet's dad was a NATO diplomat, if you think that shit didn't help that fat fuck then not only are you retarded but also delusional.  Now stfu about RT articles and white house statements. If you actually knew what the fuck was going to happen you'd be chilling in Hawaii with a fat titty chick not on Reddit posting "geopolitical positions".

Btw I'm trying to set something up I don't have to watch for a few weeks. On an African safari for a couple weeks without regular Internet access. Might be the most profitable trading timeframe in my career since I won't be able to second guess, paper hand and trade on hopium.. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated!
141	1	I've been doing TA for 10 years now, and I think it's absolute shit because the markets are obviously rigged and the fed is manipulating them with the money printer. With that said, this is a pretty big signal that I wouldn't ignore.   [200 SMA crossover and gravestone doji](https://preview.redd.it/dpoj818khgn81.png?width=1321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa3006b0ab8283059121008800572aa9133b2c0)  The 200SMA just crossed into bearish territory. The actual crossover has been in the works for a while as you can see the downward trend, however this is confirmation of a change direction. At the same time today's candle represents a gravestone doji. The market was up but rejected that and sold off.   *Processing img 0l4t6pgijgn81...*  To provide a little more perspective this is how often the 200 SMA has crossed since 2017. Prior to this it crossed in 2015, 2011 and 2008. My gut feeling is we are going down, however it's hard to say how bad it will be, but the signal is here.   Also consider that Wednesday Powell &amp; Co will announce a 25-50 basis point raise in the rates (currently expected). This may or may not be priced in, however at the moment I think it's hard to see the markets pumping in the first few days of that announcement.   My analysis is that you should have been holding inverse ETFs like SPXS and TZA and puts starting at the top, like I told you when it was at the top. If you aren't already holding it's probably not too late to get in just look for a good entry (when the market pumps).

793	0	Just wanted to see if I'm missing anything in this theoretical strategy.  So let's say I believe the next 9 months are going to have raised volatility due to possible war, Fed policy and inflation, would it be wise to long a volatility index in order to capture that increase in volatility regardless of if the markets go up or down? Looking back at the things that have caused the vix to spike I believe any one of the catalysts we may see in the short term could cause the vix to spike again. Does anyone see any glaring holes in this and how it could go bad if anything other then low volatility happens?

818	0	There is a consistent message across different media that inflation is worse than what is being reported. If the consequences are known to be very bad, preventative or corrective actions become an extremely high priority.  Wouldn't it make absolute perfect sense for the FED to *increase rates by a large amount* and to *do it very quickly*?  Who cares about the short term stock market when we are facing a country-killer or something that could snowball and ruin the economy for decades?
791	0	$SPG has been rapidly growing since COVID, **reaching as high as near $170/share back in November.** It has since then been trying to climb back to its highs but struggled to get there, **sitting at $145 today**. However, if you zoom out and look at the chart, it's on an **upward trend** to retest the highs.   If you don't know about $SPG, the company basically owns a lot of luxury malls. In Q4, if you think about the events, there were Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas which a lot of people that were spending less during the first part of COVID were getting back to the mall. Especially with the news of Omicron potentially being the end of COVID or "live with COVID" phase, more **people are willing to spend** outside for food, clothing and more.   My approach to this upcoming earning on Monday (after-hours) is to go aggressive in buying OTM calls (probably $160 strike price) given that the expiration is not until Friday. **This means that if I'm right and the earning pops, but doesn't get to $160, I can still profit from increase in stock price.** Historically, $SPG earnings has been good thus far.   [From my last post of gaining $165K over night](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skkm6t/160k_gain_porn_snap_calls_spy_calls/hvoore8/?context=3), I'm willing to be aggressive with this approach and going to by **\~$20K worth of calls at $160 strike price.** That gives me roughly **200 contracts.** If this works out well, I can easily see a 4 or 5 bagger after earnings. However, of course, the risk is that I'd lose all of it but meh, I'll make it back doing $SPY swing trades. The better approach would be to profit $20K or more doing $SPY call/put trades so that I can just YOLO the winnings into $SPG earnings.   Anyways, wish me luck and see you on Monday AH!
957	0	I propose a ban on image only posts along with stricter enforcement of rule 2 (useless content), rule 7 (no bullshitting), and positions or ban.  The quality of posts since the 2021 squeeze has gone down considerably. The amount of posts that are image only, without any additional commentary, and without any contribution to overall discussion is, quite frankly, disgusting.  It's not that there are no more actual DD's getting posted, but browsing new is the only way to see them and that involves sorting through mountains of garbage.

Even the post he made stating that he's going balls deeper is sitting at 13.  What I mean to say is that normie meme posts have entirely drowned out the genuine discussion that used to take place here. One of the reasons I believe this is going on is the influx of posts that consist only of an image and title. Go to the main page and sort by hot or top/day. The posts are almost sure to be screencaps of twitter trending, screencaps of articles, something about inversing Jim Cramer, or spy up/down pls laugh. How long did you have to scroll before you hit anything that had something to say in the body of the post? Even comments are absolutely devoid of thought, resembling something closer to r/all top comments, mainly being based on puns or jokes. Now go on WayBack and pick anytime before \\\~Nov 2020, the top/hot posts will be 1 or 2 shitposts and then a torrent of words.  I believe this forum exists primarily to allow for technical discussion by individuals who have an incredibly large appetite for risk and secondarily to blow off some steam from the extreme emotions that said risk entails. Sometime in the last year, probably on or around 28-Jan-2021, those priorities reversed. And while meme posters can exist in a technical forum, technical individuals will eventually find it impossible to have any meaningful discussions in a meme forum.  I do realize that image only posts may also include some gain/loss/yolo posts. However, these posts can easily include a recap of why they chose the positions before going into the trade along with a post-trade breakdown on why they're either a crystal-ball fortune telling genius or why the market is actually wrong.  &amp;#x200B;  Positions:  Long: GME (selling weekly CSPs, 300 shares), FNB (200 shares), O (250 shares)  Short: This dick , anything with the word coin in it, MTCH (Weekly puts), BAC (2023 puts), DPZ (monthly puts)

602	1	Between removing the invaluable aux port so users are more likely to buy airpods, removing the 128GB option (THE BEST CHOICE) so users are practically forced to pay more for the 256GB model, selling charging cables separately, refusing to innovate in any other area than adding more cameras to the back of the phone, making user‚Äôs devices failure imminent if their IOS is upgraded, not allowing users to turn off or cover their cameras to avoid invasive hacking, creating trackers that can be used to stalk people, taking 30% from developers profits, and pushing out near identical products every year, i‚Äôd say that there needs to be a push to initiate a response to these issues.  Consumers need to join together and not let these corrupt assholes walk all over them.   We want to see some positive improvements.

Last week, he said buy SARK, trashed Cathie .. and behold Friday to today we can see how ark holdings popped and shorts covering happend in many growth sectors. It's not normal to see 2x above average volume on 2-3 tradeing days.  Today he says buy Ark items? He did not say buy arkk.. do you see the difference! Buying ark holdings will directly profit the short sellers where buying the etf the cash go to Cathie first and then she has control.

202	1	and here is why: because the government simply can't afford it!   What do you think there will be another Volker who will raise rates up to 10% or more? Forget about it.    For one the economy couldn't handle it, but more important the government could neither! Do the math on how much even only the interest on the debt would be if we had rates at 3%. Not affordable. Won't happen, I'll tell you.      Also, the Fed is NOT independent of the government. It sure is written in there, but that doesn't mean a lot.      So what to do?     Well, the dollar is going to be wrecked for sure.      It's probably safe to say that any other form of store of value where you don't lose money at least is your job to find.
841	1	Directed  at WSB retards from before GME. I come humbly as one of the baghodlers  of 2022 to seek the opinion of the retards of old. **I prostrate myself at your crinkly old feet.**  Recently,  there was a post about Ortex data which peaked my interest. The  borrowing rate doubled since last week. Normally this wouldn't have  interested me, but when I looked into it the doubling rate seems to be  accelerating towards a doubling every 24 hours.  Unsure  if this meant anything, I decided to look at old WSB posts and noticed  Ortex had similar readings last year - 2 weeks before the sneeze.  I now seek your wisdom. Does any of this "new" data have any meaning?  ==============================================  **(1-22-21 ) pre-January '21:**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme\_moass\_update\_ortex\_data\_12221/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme_moass_update_ortex_data_12221/)  **( 2-3-22 ) Today's Post,** curiosity of  [u/Gnurx](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gnurx/):  [https://preview.redd.it/5mwudy27rnf81.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48f86e2901316300f73992a0a480a8e00d383f7](https://preview.redd.it/5mwudy27rnf81.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48f86e2901316300f73992a0a480a8e00d383f7)  [https://preview.redd.it/ddbs6el7rnf81.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32fb626f115348181630b02095cf89693ce6a4ac](https://preview.redd.it/ddbs6el7rnf81.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32fb626f115348181630b02095cf89693ce6a4ac)  Shows  a Borrowing Fee doubling rate of \~24 hours the past week. At the  current of increase we'll have the same borrowing rate as 1-22-21 next  week.  Borrowing Fee: \~12%  Days to Cover: \~5 days  ==============================================  **Questions:**  Did Ortex change their calculations the way S3 did? Can any of this be trusted?  What's your take on the other metrics besides borrowing fee?  What's missing between then and now?  Gary @ SEC mentions ability to postpone trading for up to 10 trading days - effect?

435	0	My whiskey fueled thought tonight is this - the human race is terrible at understanding the likelihood that the worst case scenario will happen even when presented with near certain evidence that it will. A little over two years ago, no one in the USA thought the we were on the verge of a 2 year pandemic despite overwhelming evidence in China that pointed to the contrary. A month ago, Ukrainians were in denial about a possible Russian attack on their border despite all evidence pointing to Russia planning an imminent invasion. US intel got both of these situations right, but everyone else laughed at their predictions. Our president thought it was crazy and refused to take steps to better handle the pandemic. Ukrainians chose to live in denial wasting precious time preparing for an imminent Russian invasion.    This is a pattern that has happened throughout history. During WWII, European towns that were under direct threat of Nazi attack, mostly lived in denial, and because of this few of them left before the Nazi‚Äôs came. The ones that did leave were able to see past their denial. They could separate their emotions and fears from the situation, and rationally come to an understanding of what was about to happen.  In 2008, many refused to believe the housing market would collapse despite a lot of evidence that it would, a few guys figured it out and now they have enough tendies for life. These predictions are all seen as brilliant prognostications, but really these folks were just willing to accept that the worst could happen. They were willing to live outside of their subconscious denial that clouds everyone‚Äôs judgment during challenging times.   So when faced with overwhelming evidence that the worst case scenario might happen, don‚Äôt ignore it. Don‚Äôt think you are silly or misinformed. Trust the evidence and ignore folks that are telling you that you are crazy.  That instinct may save your life, your country, and/or make you all the tendies.

277	1	Looks like it's time to buy puts for Putin. The discussion of an upcoming oil embargo peaked oil up to $140, almost an increase of 20 %, and now it's lying around $130. Oil price hasn't been this high since 2008, and with both an oil price so high that it can decrease growth and trigger a recession, and high inflation, we might be going into stagflation in the near future.  Of course, I currently just have SPY calls. Lost 7k last couple of weeks. Fuck you Putin.

Trading starts around 5pm EST SUNDAY.    The reason it's bounced back from the lows is because of central bank intervention or fear thereof. It sounds like it's going to be a lot more difficult with the Central Bank cut off and the SWIFT sanctions.

129	1	 **Synopsis**  ## The rapid spread of the omicron variant in China is increasing the pressure on already strained supply chains reeling from Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.  &amp;#x200B;   "The number of container ships waiting off Qingdao, one of China‚Äôs biggest ports, is continuing to rise as the country doubles down on its Covid Zero policy, adding more delays to a strained global supply chain.     About 72 vessels were spotted off Qingdao port in Shandong Monday, almost double the amount at the end of February, according to shipping data compiled by Bloomberg. The increased delays there and in other parts of China are expected to **push up freight rates.**  &amp;#x200B;   While there is usually a build-up of vessels seeking to enter China following the Lunar New Year holidays, volumes this year are being exacerbated by lockdowns aimed at curbing new coronavirus outbreaks.      ‚ÄúThe virus outbreaks are sprouting up in different parts of China, and lockdown measures do not seem as effective because the transmissibility of the new variants are higher,‚Äù said Salmon Aidan Lee, head of polyesters at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. ‚ÄúThat leaves us with a situation that has worsened in the past few days at Qingdao,‚Äù he said, adding that he expects freight rates to rise because of increasing delays.     There‚Äôs also a growing backlog of vessels off the ports of Shangha¬† Ningbo and Zhoushan. There were 262 ships counted there, up from 243 a week ago. However the situation off Shenzhen and Hong Kong has eased a bit, dropping to 162 vessels from 208 on March 7...."

126	1	A few notes on some of the players:  EU: Germany/Italy have tied themselves to Russian energy. Unwilling to accept short term pain in order to get rid of Russia. That's why EU sanctions have hit a ceiling. They need to be pushed.  Russia: Will not stop until they either take Ukraine or Putin is toppled. Dictators rarely fall from the outside, hence the sanctions. There's at least one bank left out of sanctions, so Putin and the oligarchs are ok. Hence the West's huge aid to Ukraine, to allow it to keep fighting while the sanctions take effect.  Ukraine's image management is too sophisticated, so it's obvious they are getting a ton of help from foreign intelligence services.  They suddenly took quite a turn with their 'negotiations' with Russia. For some bizarre reason the Ukrainians keep spinning the negotiations as positive, constructive, working towards a ceasefire etc. Zelensky himself keeps hinting of giving in to Russia's official demands. It all feels as if they are about to sign a peace treaty, yet they keep asking for guns and to close the skies. Something's fishy.  **My theory is this:**   USA is dead-set on using Ukraine to get rid of Russia. However, EU is now stalling and USA is realizing that Ukraine will lose without further hardcore support.   I suspect the British (their intelligence services are just the best) are advising Ukraine to pretend that it's leaning close to accepting Russia's demands, hence all the positive spin on negotiations. This is lighting a fire on USAs backside to do more, faster. It needs to push EU to join the complete ban of energy/trade. This is why Biden is coming to EU next week. This is why the bordering countries to Ukraine went to visit today and started muttering things about a 'peace force' moving into Ukraine from EU to oversee things.   Coincidentally, Republicans+Democrats are pushing a motion through senate to ban all Russian banks, which would forbid every country in the world from giving Russia a single dollar. This is targeting China and Germany/Italy. They want to use this as a stick when Biden goes to EU next week to push EU to do more.   USA has already stopped energy imports from Russia and banned all trade. USA has nothing to lose by banning the remaining Russian banks and using its force to push its allies to do more, willingly or not. If China breaks the sanctions it will give USA the perfect excuse to apply penalties to them as well.   I foresee a complete ban of energy trade with Russia. Military intervention from NATO or a 'peace keeping force' that will act as bait to give pretext to NATO going in is also a good bet. They will not get rid of Putin without military intervention or insane financial pressure.   I do not see this ending with Ukraine signing half the country away in a peace treaty. This is too good of a chance for USA to let it go. Things will only escalate further.  Positions: SPY puts, MOS, USO, WEAT (I know it's not 'the' wheat we want but futures cost $50k and it behaves similarly)

Too many of you were buying puts to not try something like this  Given how AMZN went up AH, hopefully I get assigned and can make max profit tomorrow morning   If I don't get assigned, what moves can I make to get profits? Idk if I'll have collateral to buy out the call I had sold . Have only orange crayons btw and trying anything more complicated than a call for the first time. I had MTCH 100$ puts that I made big losses on
764	0	When I was I college, I signed up for SeekingArrangments.com. I was naive to say the least. I was connected to Larry Ellison. I met him in Redwood City at a ‚Äòrestaurant‚Äô. We shared some wine and he tipped the waitress $100. She was clearly nervous and didn‚Äôt check my ID.   He took me back to his house in his red Ferrari. As we approached his house, there was security at front. The security guard just stared at me (very bright lights) as we drove through. He showed me his collection of cars. In particular, he pointed out his grey/black Bugatti. We went inside and his Asian chef cooked us dinner. She didn‚Äôt say much to me. After dinner, he showed me his coy fish in the pod and I was impressed. When he clapped, they jumped. After dinner, I told him I had to call my mom to say goodnight. I called her (outbound number was blocked) and my mom didn‚Äôt know it was me. No phones were allowed at his house. After the call, he wanted to go upstairs to talk more. I felt very uncomfortable and what happened felt forced. After some time has passed, I feel like this was extremely inappropriate and damaging to my self worth. Was I wrong to engage in this
80	1	So here it is. It‚Äôs spring soon.  Without a peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia in a week, I‚Äôm not sure where things will go, in a bad way. This is the time we need to pray. Because there will be no going back.  Why?  Wheat plant season starts. Without the bread basket of the world producing, unfortunately we will lose about a third of wheat.  This means nations that aren‚Äôt as affluent as ours will lose food. Our nations will begin to hoard and prices for everything wheat based will rise.  Not only wheat but corn and fertilizer.  Russia has begun as well to disrupt exports from Ukraine:    https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-war-russia-blocks-ships-carrying-grain-exports/a-61165985  I‚Äôm sad about this. What Russia has done has not only created these problems of killing innocent people, but now has set of a chain of events where the world food supply is at risk.  If the spring farming season is impacted, this will lead to a year or more of food supply impact.  Everything will begin to be inflated.  Some farms around the world have begun trimming acres from what they‚Äôve been farming because the cost of fertilizer.  Putin needs to make a deal asap. And stop this foolishness.  I‚Äôm afraid he won‚Äôt, this will lead to a 2nd to 3rd orders of effects in our economy.  Companies and nations will begin to vertically align their food supply chain. Russian people (not those fucking nationalist idiots happy for the killing of Ukrainians) will be poorer. Many have lost their jobs.  This is a slow nuclear bomb situation. Russia is completely done. Even if we get a deal we will start removing Russia.  So now we have the WSB portion:  Short term of course what I will get and have:  WEAT, USO, BOIL, MOS, VALE, URA  May get CORN, and some other uranium, nickel, oil, natural gas, fertilizer stocks.  Long term:  China stocks and economy are slowly going to go down.  We don‚Äôt want to deal with countries like this again, and calls will start to stop relying on these countries that can fuck us over.  GMO stocks. A buy in my opinion, since now food supply will need science to keep producing food.  Post conflict order:  US vs China  Blah‚Ä¶ maybe another post‚Ä¶

Our free money glitch remained unpatched with $SNAP moving 60% (yes, SIXTY) post earnings, ruining short sellers and market makers alike. $FB and $AMZN also provided us with extremely large moves letting us profit handsomely given that we were on the right side of the trade. We‚Äôve got a mishmash of random stocks reporting this week ranging from blue-chips to volatile growth. I hope this week is as crazy as the last! Let‚Äôs get into it.  &amp;nbsp;  ---  #The Spreadsheet To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKazfWEo2kghgrBU0EjBFqVREhqGyhac-PsQV0LvuIw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!  &amp;nbsp;  - **Growth stocks may get propped up or annihilated based on general market volatility.** If the entire market is dying yet, *&lt;insert growth stock here&gt;* reports a stellar earnings, it may still get dragged down. The same goes for the opposite. We saw that with a boatload of mega-caps last week. Since this week has lots of wonky growth stocks reporting, don‚Äôt put all of your eggs in one basket. This added volatility adds extra risk to ALL of our trades, whether you‚Äôre short or long, or buying or selling.  &amp;nbsp;  - **Do NOT bet against Lourenco Goncalves.** $CLF reports earnings on Friday, and I expect an insane quarter out of them. Analyst estimates are down, yet last quarter LG said that this quarter will be their strongest in history, leading me to believe that a beat is not priced in whatsoever. The expected numbers are actually WORSE than last quarter, yet the CEO literally told us this quarter will be better than last, setting us up for a surefire beat. To top it all off, there has been some pretty crazy insider buying going on over at $CLF, adding even more confidence to my trade. I know people roll their eyes at this, but around 10% of the entire float is shorted, which may further increase buying pressure on $CLF post earnings. Regardless of if you choose to trade it or not, make sure you don‚Äôt play the short side of this trade, as it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.  &amp;nbsp;  - **$CHGG has some notable insider buying.** There has literally never been insider buying in the history of the company up until this month, where the CFO, CEO, and Director added to their positions handsomely. At first glance, I‚Äôm inclined to be bearish on Chegg because they singlehandedly ratted out a bunch of my friends in university, but the insiders think otherwise. $CHGG also puts up some pretty gnarly moves post earnings, so if you‚Äôre correct on this gamble, you could be looking at a clean 10 bagger. Similar to $CLF, regardless of how you decide to play this ticker, I would not want to be short.  &amp;nbsp;  - **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we‚Äôll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience.

953	1	Anyways, Bed Bath and Beyond is going to squeeze, and here‚Äôs why:  According to the latest short interest data from Nasdaq there are about 27,000,000 shares sold short. According to yahoo data the percentage of float sold short is 66.18%. This would mean that there is approximately 41,000,000 shares in the total float(available to be bought and sold). In the last earnings call, CEO Mark Tritton said they have $265,000,000 remaining of buyback which is to be concluded by the end of their fiscal year (end of February). The average share price since then has been $14 would equal about 19,000,000 shares being bought back. This means after the buyback is complete the float will now be roughly 22 million shares. With nearly 27 million shares sold short, we will have a short interest of over 122%, similar to GME before it squeezed. (Edit) Shares outstanding is 96 million which includes shares owned by the company. Some of you are seriously smooth brained.
153	0	"stocks go up" A common Wall Street Bets idiom. On the surface that statement sounds retarded. But I implore you all to take this to heart. You see betting against the stock market will never be as profitable as the upside. Example A: If someone is to short a stock the maximum they can win is 100%, say you buy a stock at $100 and short it,  then that company somehow looses all it's value, you gain 100%, great good for you. Now if I buy a a stock a $1 and it goes to $100 I gained 10,000%. Hmmm...  what way do I bet, up or down? And this my fine feathered Friends is why the stock market will always make you money. In conclusion always buy never sell and never ever short anything.

606	1	**TLDR**:   $JOBY is an electric vertical takeoff/landing (eVTOL) aircraft company that will provide hub-to-hub travel ~2026. eVTOLs are the love child of airplanes and helicopters and bring together the best of both because they‚Äôre cheap, fast, and convenient. In the eVTOL space, $JOBY has the best tech, hands down. They will be first to mass market, and accessible to most people. Current share price is ~$6.00 at $3.6B valuation but an appropriate price target is $70/share by 2024. Read below.   If you don‚Äôt want to, watch this video [2:29]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itP8-3j2UZI  **Background**  Imagine you‚Äôre in DC and want to get to Philly. It‚Äôs a 2.5 hour drive because it‚Äôs too short of a distance to fly conventionally. But &gt;current year 2026 so what you actually do is you book a flight with Joby through Uber. You head to the nearest parking garage, wait for your ride, and get there in under an hour. All for under $100. That‚Äôs what Joby is promising.   This is all possible because of tech that surpasses that of any other eVTOL competitors such as Lillium, Ehang, Volvcopter, Archer, etc. The key innovations are 1) reducing noise and 2) increasing safety. Background: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nbz5VFilxY  The bigger obstacle is noise, not safety. Joby has to prove that its presence isn‚Äôt going to impact you if you‚Äôre not a customer. Alice and Bob don‚Äôt want to hear teeth-rattling helicopters at 7:00AM picking up the neighborhood‚Äôs multi-millionaire for work. End of story. Joby addresses this problem with new prop technology that is a LOT quieter. Listen for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itP8-3j2UZI This is the coolest thing about Joby, by far.  Then safety. You have to make sure that the people that are using your service feel safe. In the 80s and 90s, cities banned helicopters because of safety concerns, specifically because of fatal  helicopter accidents. But the S4 (the name of the aircraft) is a technological and engineering masterpiece. It‚Äôs extremely safe and reliable with layers and layers of redundancy. Each propeller is powered by two motors, each with their own inverter. There are two power sources, in case one fails, and three flight computers. You don‚Äôt even need all six props to fly. If all goes to hell, the S4 can glide like a plane, because it has wings. You can expect Joby to make this fact known prior to commercial operations. People will feel safe.  **All this is nice, but do the numbers work? Take the following with a grain of salt:**  Let‚Äôs be really generous and assume that every trip takes 4 passengers (full capacity), each of whom are charged approximately $3 per mile flown (target goal). Assume that each trip is 25 miles and takes 15 mins with a 5 min turnaround, so Joby is able to make 3 trips an hour. Assume 24/7 operation, like any other airline. That‚Äôs (3 * 25 * 4 * 3 * 24 * 7 * 365) = $55.18 Million in revenue a year, per aircraft. Even if Joby operated with 3% efficiency, that‚Äôs still $1.6M in revenue per aircraft per year.  $1.6M annually per aircraft is a conservative estimate that is in line with other analysts. Morgan Stanley expects 300 aircraft to provide $500 Million in revenue which works out the same. With that in mind MS has established a price target of $21 with 3x potential from there (seeking alpha link banned) The original price target was $16: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/joby-stock-higher-morgan-stanley-initiates-overweight My estimate is slightly north of Morgan Stanley‚Äôs at $70, taking into account applications not just for commuting (I elaborate below).   **Timeline**  A couple things stand in the way of commercial operation: 1) An air carrier certificate (in order to act as an ‚Äòairline‚Äô) 2) An aircraft type certificate (what kind of aircraft is Joby?) and 3) Pilots. This Part 23/Part 135 stuff is really specific aviation stuff. You can read more about it here: https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/july/29/joby-moves-on-part-135-certificate But it‚Äôs essentially regulation about which regulation should apply to Joby‚Äôs S4s since the airframe is so different than anything before it.   By far,  the FAA is the biggest unknown prerevenue and the most likely to affect share price in the short term. I have no doubt that Joby will become a commercial success once the FAA gives the green light. Until then, approvals and delays from the FAA will have the biggest impact on the stock. Good news is that everything is on track as of now i.e. 2024 commercial operations.   **Commercial operations never come. Is it over?**  Well, I think it‚Äôs unlikely that commercial operations don‚Äôt ever come. Joby has been working on passenger transport since 2009 and could have bailed far earlier if that was a bad business model. Furthermore, Joby isn‚Äôt planning to launch in just the United States, but also in South Korea and Japan. That‚Äôs what sent Joby‚Äôs stock soaring this/last week, despite the market being wonked. That is diversification of revenues and risk and is really good for Joby‚Äôs long term health.  $JOBY + SKT: https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/06/joby-aviation-to-launch-air-taxi-service-in-south-korea/  $JOBY + ANA: https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Transportation/Flying-car-startup-Joby-lands-partnership-with-Japan-s-ANA  Even if commercial operations commuting really get sidelined, it‚Äôs not completely over.  Joby‚Äôs aircraft can still be used for tourism, cargo transport, search and rescue, and military applications - especially military applications. The USAF has certified Joby's and I expect orders to come. The S4 is ideal for personnel and cargo transport over short distances. There are probably other applications as well‚Ä¶  **The valuation**  All this leads to the most important question, really. What is Joby‚Äôs fair price? Why is Joby sitting at $6.00/share and a $3.6B valuation when it has so much potential? It comes down to market mechanics and risk.  Despite all the potential Joby has, it is still a prerevenue company. And in all fairness, the risks to the timeline of commercial launch are considerable. That makes $JOBY a speculative investment, and with that comes a bunch of baggage.   Because of how institutional investment works, a lot of fund prospectuses (the rules of investing for a particular fund) do not allow speculative investments. Without the steady inflow of institutional capital, Joby‚Äôs share price is simply going to see a lot of volatility, as trading is mainly driven by arbitrageurs, insiders, day traders, retail, hedge funds, and other speculators that aren‚Äôt holding Joby for long time frames.   Also, Joby is simply under the radar (ha). Not a lot of people know about it or its potential yet (just like Netflix in 2008, Moderna in 2019, and IONQ today). JOBY is going to see the same volatility in its early days like big names today, e.g. TSLA.  But one day out of the blue, JOBY will have a stellar quarterly/annual report that will establish fundamentals and catapult it into the limelight, at which it‚Äôs valuation will simply balloon. Share price will appreciate the most at this moment when JOBY has proven itself to both investors and speculators.  **How to play this?**  Carefully. Because of some of the risks associated with the timeline, I‚Äôd be careful about anything with an expiration date. With stock so cheap right now, there‚Äôs little reason to hold options over stock. However, I‚Äôm also not blind to the fact that JOBY might suddenly pop x10 when people realize what a gem it is. That‚Äôs why I have some Jan 23s sprinkled in. But you do you. This is not financial advice.   **Other** I‚Äôm pretty bullish on JOBY but you should balance your diet with other takes.

464	0	I can‚Äôt believe something so incredibly stupid is happening again, but here we are. War is terrible for humans and similarly great for media. There is no media a immediate and in the moment for these situations as Twitter. With Spaces going up all over the place, it is really well positioned.
344	1	Ukraine War.  Looming Russian Oil sanctions.  Domestic production ramping up at fever pitch.  Stock price ranges from $3.50 to .50 cents in the last 14 months.  Sitting at $1.10 this morning and I bit off all I could chew!
851	0	I just watched that 2 hour [Line Goes Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) video and now I'm all Steve Carell "short everything that guy has touched" over here. Apparently Visa has one that it dropped $150k on ([source](https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2021/08/18/nfts-mark-a-1629328216374.html)) and I'm long them so time to dump it.  Others?
763	1	After we all got conned by Amazon when they counted their Rivian stake as part of their earnings, I was looking into Uber (reporting this week). Uber has stakes in several money losing companies such as Didi, Aurora, Grab and something called Joby ([https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3159754/uber-looking-sell-didi-other-non-strategic-stakes-ceo-says](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3159754/uber-looking-sell-didi-other-non-strategic-stakes-ceo-says)).  All of these are now publicly traded, and they're getting shit on as soon as they IPO. It seems like every time these holdings IPO it provides a one time boost to EPS, then the next quarter when the holdings tank, it hurts EPS ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/uber-lost-2-billion-in-didi-stake-this-week-on-china-crackdown-threat.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/uber-lost-2-billion-in-didi-stake-this-week-on-china-crackdown-threat.html)).  Didi, Grab and Joby have been trading already, and based on their stock dipping in q4, they should hurt Uber q4 eps, but Aurora IPO'd in November, which I assume would boost eps. Is that how this works? IPO = insta gain? Or was Aurora valuation already privately valued and any gain would be IPO price minus private valuation price?   Is all of this already priced in? Are puts worth it? I'm also weighing whether Uber becoming semi profitable will make it do a SNAP this week, or if omicron/labor pressures will hurt q1 guidance. Any insight is welcome.
462	0	Looking to throw some money into some puts but not sure which ones exactly I should be looking into. I was debating on either TSLA or LCID, but not 100% sure on which one or if others would be better. Any help/opinions would be great.
502	1	I'm sure you folks have been waiting patiently for some time. I've been keeping an eye on GME &amp; AMC for months on end. Multiple notifications have rung over the week but weren't able to take a peak until now after fixing my login.  Whether you feel bullish or bearish, wouldn't be the first time I've caught these two exploding &amp; or rebounding (see GME post when it was $45).  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/z69l0idwlbj81.png?width=2038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15138097a8cc2a3d423746ab73448b97e171e89e  https://preview.redd.it/tzs1undwlbj81.png?width=2494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc9d5f3075eb8709b6239acde99ca74698289efc
161	1	I have been running the numbers, and things aren't looking good. My mother's husband's wife boyfriend is big in the stock game, and he was frowning this morning when he read the newspaper. Look at this graph I just saw on Bloomberg:  [I'm not a genius but this bad.](https://preview.redd.it/xx5q7irv43n81.png?width=2026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=771820367437b408f8b3c698a782ea0bbb7a00bf)  It gets worse guys. Have you heard about this thing in Ukraine? I hear Russia refuses to sell gas to them and that is pretty messed up. If I didn't ride a bike to my Wendy's shifts I would have to pay at least a McChicken more in gas money more than I usually do. (bullish on bike sellers btw)  I did some independent journalism because I don't trust the MSM. Look at this consumer report I found:  [boom.](https://preview.redd.it/bdrhqwnw53n81.png?width=343&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a15e6b0bbe4b43b7757ebf07bb14a1666e7e60f)  Pretty bad if you ask me. While we are on the news of bad have you heard of this little know country called China??? I know their economy is on the brink because I did not hear one person talk about the olympic games, hell I didn't even know they were happening. More people watched my sister's dance recital than the olympics, and I didn't even make a scene this time! Look at this chart regarding the hosing market!  [boom. \(pt 2\)](https://preview.redd.it/8hlmtg6f63n81.png?width=355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b16e1b714b9fc5dfd21a1ceca814b8766648deca)  And don't even get me started on the MM in the market, those billion dollar giants are more screwed than the rest of us. Why? Because they had the gall to loan me money (bearish on my credit card bills). Margin call that Visa.  Finally, I know this is bad because I've seen at least 3 facebook posts from my uncle talking about how the US government is going to fall like Rome did. Overall, I follow retail, and when all of retail assumes that the affects of gas, fed rates and war aren't priced in, that's when I know to sell.   Overall, It's time to corner some rare vegetable markets, the only commodities I trust.

541	1	There are many jurisdictions I will never invest in again: China, Russia, and Belgium (look up policy on buybacks/dividends üôÑ) are among them.  I'm thinking of pulling everything from Canada. They have world class natural resources in mining and energy, but I can‚Äôt see those operations being unaffected by the crackdown on truckers.  This isn‚Äôt political: resource extraction relies heavily on trucking and heavy machinery. This was already a tight labor market and supply chains mean that larger pieces of equipment are taken Offline indefinitely.  take oil for example: there are something like \~1000 extra oil rigs that are offline and usable on paper. However, many suppliers are ‚Äúsold out‚Äù through 2022 and maybe even 2023.  \~250 are missing some small part that is on back order that makes the rigs inoperable. The other rigs aren‚Äôt super useful because there is a labor shortage for oil workers....and even if you pay ppl more to work the oil fields it doesn‚Äôt really make sense to hire a lot of ppl because TRUCKERS are already a huge bottleneck on transporting the necessary resources/equipment.  Political Jurisdiction Risk: Canada has proven it will freeze bank accounts at a whim. I don‚Äôt know if it makes sense to keep money in a place with that kind of risk. The reason I am worried is bc the economy and tax revenue are pretty good and society is relatively stable based on how crazy things could get. If we do go into a recession, the government will start looking for reasons to hike taxes or confiscate assets. Mining and energy are especially vulnerable to this in the past. see the many countries that nationalized their resource sectors or even the USA who levied a huge ‚Äúwindfall‚Äù tax on oil companies who made too much money.   with the Canadian government showing that it will act at the drop of a hat, I‚Äôm not sure investments will remain sound moving forward.  my play? I think oil companies will get nationalized/taxed for ‚Äúgreed‚Äù pretty soon, so I cannot invest there. I do think it makes sense to buy calls on resources themselves since those should skyrocket due to declining supply. I think the best play is oil futures, and calls on GLD.  not only will this play benefit from inflation, but you can gain the leverage of a resource miner without the risk of excess regulation/confiscation/taxation.  the most convex strategy seems to be selling a GLD Put out to 2024 at a strike price of $320 and using the premium to buy 70 calls on GLD at a strike of $320.   gold will have to double for the calls to hit, but you should benefit from any large volatility spikes. Also, selling the put ensures that if GLD increases within the next 2 years you decreased the price of your bet.   lastly, the risk seems pretty low. The most you can lose is $32,000....but gold would have to fall massively and GLD would have to get delisted, which seems like a black swan event.   anyways, I am not going to enter this trade yet. I will wait until the fed raises rates in March since I think there will be a pullback and you can enter the trade with more convexity.      i‚Äòll update you when I enter the trade   üöÄüöÄüöÄüòé

503	1	I just finished binge watching death note on Netflix, so I think I know how deductive reasoning works. I do not think Putin will invade Ukraine because he has been doing everything in his power not to invade Ukraine.   Think about it. He moves troops up to the border, tries to antagonize Ukraine, and fails. Then he tries a false flag as a justification. Fails. Then he becomes allies with two city states because he maxed out the patronage tree in civ 5. But, he STILL HAS REFUSED TO ACTUALLY INVADE.  Guys come on. The dude is doing anything and everything not to actually invade Ukraine. If he really wanted to he could have done it 100 different ways by now.  Untill he actually orders the invasion, my calls for may are staying put. My opinion is we will see green in the coming weeks, especially because so many people are going to become bearish only for this invasion not to happen. Then they're going to squeeze themselves trying to get out of their infinite loss positions and we're going to see a big move up.  Or I'm wrong. Idk. I only have 15% of my money in the market right now anyway so if we do go down I'll just buy.  Good luck in the casino everyone.

Yesterday I bought Enphase calls with the money I sold my car with. I‚Äôve got 8k in shares as well (average price $60). For the record I did sell 10% of my position when Enphase hit $283/share.

847	0	As earnings season continues, it is all the more important to ensure that implied volatility doesn't assfuck all of you. Here's (kind of) how to do this.  basically, if you buy an option around earnings, **the gain in intrinsic value has to exceed the drop in extrinsic value** (both the theta decay (because I'm assuming us retards are buying calls or puts expiring the Friday of that earnings week) as well as the drop in implied volatility).  &amp;#x200B;   To do this, **buy a call or put that you expect will be decently itm** after earnings. this means **DONT BUY THE FUCKING 50% OTM CALL OPTIONS ON AN EARNINGS REPORT THAT YOU EXPECT WILL MOVE 10%.**   &amp;#x200B;  example: I bought 25c 2/4 snap calls earlier today before earnings hoping for good news (i received something truly glorious) and now those calls went from 0 intrinsic value to being 14 dollars in the money, giving it 14 dollars worth of intrinsic value.   I paid 2.55 (average) per contract (pure extrinsic value) and even if total extrinsic value declines by 100% (which is impossible until expiration, but expiration is tomorrow so) the contracts are still worth $14.00 in premium.   &amp;#x200B;  in conclusion, don't be retarded like this guy (he bought the $34 call even though he expected the stock to be at $33):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh9zt5/10125\_daily\_loss/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh9zt5/10125_daily_loss/)  and instead buy contracts that you think are going to be itm at expiration (and greater than your premium, so basically higher than your breakeven)     good luck retards.

363	0	I don‚Äôt know why nobody has thought of this before. Think about it:  * SQQQ pretty much only goes down. It‚Äôs designed to go down. * If you buy puts and something goes down, you print money.   It‚Äôs obviously easy money, just buy puts on SQQQ.   Selling calls is another strategy. There is unlimited upside that way because you can sell as many as you want and some sucker or algorithm will buy it lol dumbass   Why not long TQQQ? Simple. Volatility decay means TQQQ might not go up. But SQQQ has volatility decay AND it goes down ANYWAY. So it‚Äôs pretty much guaranteed to go down.
54	1	**10x BAGGER WITH OPTIONS**  UAN Update 3/21/22  CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN) is a master limited partnership that produces the nitrogen fertilizers ammonia (NH3) and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN). Because the ticker symbol for CVR Partners is also UAN, I will use CVR to describe the partnership and UAN to describe the fertilizer. Also, because it is a partnership, the payouts to equity holders are distributions rather than dividends.  **Summary**  * Supply shortages are not temporary. * Demand will only get stronger. * Record prices for natural gas and coal in Europe and Asia will continue to support higher prices for nitrogen fertilizer. * Impending tariffs on UAN will keep most imports out of US for over 5 years. * Distributions of over $40 are expected over the next 7 months.  Estimated Price of $300 EoY  War in Ukraine is only a bigger catalyst to solidify fertilizer prices ongoing current new highs.  Buying ITM Options in December is a safe 10x Bagger waiting to happen.

I was checking out my weight loss graph and was looking at QQQ... and well, the charts speak for themselves. [Here.](https://www.imgur.com/a/UB6xEAO)  What can I say, I got mad tendies from the market and that turned into some pretty impressive 2021 gains. My weight went to all-time highs. It was unrelated to Covid anxiety and depression. Promise.  But then inflation and running low on cash, I decided to lose some weight. It was unrelated to me asking my GF for some sex and she told me that she's not looking at my dick until I can see it myself.  I feel really bad.   But I has no idea.  Anyway, let me know if you're all buried in puts and shorts or calls and longs so I can decide what to do. I'm on keto but, if wsb needs me back on pizza and tall cans, I'll see what I can do.

546	0	So, I spend 99% of the year scared as shit of equities.  Well, they spent most of the time at all-time-highs, since forever.  So, I'm looking and thinking, hmm... do I really want to buy right now, at all time highs? There's some factor that the media is spinning, be it political, health or economic related, that makes me think twice, so I do nothing.  So, I FINALLY get the balls to SELL a $SPY put $430.00 7/15 put today at the market open.  Breakeven is $407.17, so I am thinking to myself well, if I buy 100 shares at $407.17, then I'm not getting in THAT high, right? I mean it won't drop THAT low... right?  Well, now my father, who is always 100% pro-stock market, pro-indexes, pro-America, tells me that was a stupid position, and he thinks it's going down 30% next week.  So, now I'm scared to shit.  Why is it EVERY TIME I get into the market it's like I'm walking on a semi-frozen lake, and I just fall through and get frostbite.  Everybody else seems to skate just fine.   CAN'T I GET IN FOR ONCE WITHOUT GOING NEGATIVE IMMEDIATELY.  JUST ONCE!! ONE TIME FOR THE ONE TIME!  tl;dr: I suck at this.

538	1	As the post on the risk of war in Eastern Europe was closed for comments, I want to get som views out. I have no idea why the initial post was locked, hope this can stay open. Things have changed since I said there is not going to be a war. It might. Someone said Putin is smarter than people think, and that is spot on. Not that world leaders don‚Äôt know this, but the world population might not. However, he is also very much into keeping face, showing strength. This is extremely important in Russia, if you show weakness you are immediately under attack by opponents. Putin does not want to lose power, at all cost. My previous post was he has more to lose then gain by attacking Ukraine. Not anymore. The pressure from the US, NATO and in some way the EU has pushed him into a corner. If he backs down, he will look weak to Russians. That will never happen. So how to play this in the market? I don‚Äôt do investment advice, but personally I am watching oil very closely. Also Natgas, which is a long story, but might be worth a watch. A major pipeline fromRussia to Europe runs through Ukraine.
513	1	https://www.tradingview.com/x/agNnObaR  my initial thoughts seeing the futures pop on the "good news."  1. its not really good news... all that was said was that IF he doesnt invade come Thursday they will have a summit to talk... doesnt mean he isnt gonna before then. also i dont like these fake pumps based on news. generally i feel they just cause a bulltrap. just look at the FOMC and russia news friday.  2. we saw crypt0 bleed all weekend and that to me is the overall market sentiment.  3. futures are open for a weird time frame. tonight till 1pm tomorrow. then reopens at 6pm for normal. that could effect stuff. i also anticipate that this news is going to be well digested by market open Tuesdays. just look back at the green futures and pre market friday that went red all day.  4. the bigger issue here is still inflation not war. this is a distraction in my opinion and it doesnt negate whats coming in march.  supports to watch (for es)- 4358 --&gt; 4444 --&gt; 4332 --&gt; 4320. Resistance- 4377 (failed to even reach this on the initial good news pop) --&gt; 4400.   Candles trending back below the 8 ema... very well could see this pop just slow bleed.   i will be watching this closely but i wouldnt be surprised by Tuesday morning market open to see us flat or red again‚Äã.  Tuesday morning before i go to sleep i will post a detailed pre market analysis

All happening within a single trading day.  My question is this: how the FUCKITY FUCK can you try and get in early on these mooners?  I understand that they're not all necessarily short squeezes (take ISPO a couple of days ago, for example) but it happens nearly every day and it infuriates me that I miss out on these all of the time. Kind of like when I couldn't find my gf's vag and inserted it into the wrong hole instead and got shit on.  All I want to do is make back the $25k I've lost for fucks sake.

The RRF was supposed to help 300,000 mom &amp; pop restaurants recover from the pandemic but only 100,000 were funded and 200,000 received $0 and are close to bankruptcy!  Congress has been working on a bill to replenish RRF for almost a year now and all we need is 3 more Republican co-sponsors to get this done. It is now or never as our last chance is this week before election season starts and we will be forgotten.  If wallstreetbets is willing to help our cause and pick up the phone tomorrow, until the end of the week, call these key republican senators and get this over the finish line, our group will offer all wallstreetbets followers a free meal next time you come in. We are from all over the country so there will always be some of us close by.  We know everyone on here is about helping the little guy fight the corporate greed. We are trying to save the independent restaurants so we don‚Äôt all have to eat at Wendy‚Äôs for the rest of our lives.  If we get over 2,000 upvotes and 200 comments, we will consider it a deal and all you have to do is hit the phones and call these senators to co-sponsor RRF replenishment this week.

647	1	I just saw a post saying it‚Äôs stupid to buy calls before earnings because of IV crush. This earnings season I made 17k profit off of 4k invested from a GOOGL $2840 2/11 call and a CMG $1550 2/25 call.  If you‚Äôre losing money on earnings play where you know a company will beat earnings, you‚Äôre seriously impatient and don‚Äôt know how to play high volatile market plays. Both of these calls I made sure had relatively low IV, the google call had an IV of around 40% and the CMG call had an IV of 60% (Ik this is relatively high but for earnings it‚Äôs actually pretty low).   The key to my strategy which has worked super well is having excellent timing with your options for earnings. The google call was bought at 3:55 pm and the chipotle call was bought at 3:45 pm. Why? My philosophy is I want to minimize the other Greeks impact on options prices so I can capture as much gains from the high change in delta from after hours movement. By buying right before market close the day that they report earnings, I‚Äôm reducing the risk of time volatility (theta) impacting my calls or puts before the after hours movement. I always sell my calls the day after earnings report release at 9:30, regardless of gain or loss. This is because IV crush will always come the day after earnings, but if you sell at 9:30, IV is still high enough that you can capture most of the gains from the delta increase.  If you buy your calls/puts during the day of earnings planning to swing trade them after the after hours movement, you‚Äôre seriously retarded. You‚Äôre just letting your option lose value throughout the day, cause let‚Äôs be honest for earnings you want to buy week out or two week out options, due to theta. Sure, you can scalp a little extra profit if you buy at the low for the day, but it‚Äôs not worth the risk.  I swear if you follow this strategy of buying a two week out ATM or slightly OTM call at 3:55 and sell at 9:30, you can‚Äôt lose unless you pick the wrong direction.  The whole point of earnings is to capture the AH gains that change your option price enough that delta offsets the decrease in vega. By trading only for about 5 mins of market hours, you‚Äôre limiting theta‚Äôs effect on decreasing the gains from delta. I honestly don‚Äôt get how you retards can lose following this strategy. Shit I‚Äôve made a third of my salary following this strategy.  TLDR: buy your options for earnings ATM or slightly OTM with a week or two for expiry and sell at 9:30 the next gain to always win if you get the right direction.  Don‚Äôt believe me? Buy Nvidia calls with 2 weeks expiry at 3:55 and sell at 9:30 and I guarantee you at least 50% gains.  [proof](https://ibb.co/2tx13wc)

249	1	Folks,  I am still a buyer in Energy. I find OVV a very attractive value play. The move out of Canada into the US and the stock split cause a massive dump on this gem. This was because of the exist of Canadian funds as the company navigated its headquarter move to the US. In 2020, Covid blew a hole down the stock price to 2$. The silver lining is that it has rallied since then to a price of 48$. Current market cap 16.1 Billion. So why am I still buying this?  Clearly we will be getting more into a deficit in energy when summer rolls in and as demand continues to pick up. With the US planning on stopping oil imports from Russia coupled with low storage capacity of excess oil on the Russian side (8 days) I see their production getting curtailed even further. Sanctions and the fact that countries are cutting back supplies to Russia I see their oil industry failing due to lack of reliable drilling and completion equipment.   Now I understand that inflation and high oil prices signal that we are already close if not in a recession. But the fact remains, OPEC will try its best to keep oil range bound to keep partners happy and recuperate losses incurred in the past. Remember Russia has a big part to play in OPEC+ so they would influence the production numbers.   Ovintiv, is going to generate close 3 billion in cashflow at 85$ oil.  I do bet that number is going to be higher by a factor of at least 30% due to high oil prices. They also increased the dividend the last few quarters. With a current P.E ratio of 9.0 and average industry P.E. ratio at 12 (Look at Devon, Continental resources etc.). I see an appreciation of the stock price significantly. They are also due f0r induction into S&amp;P 500 which will trigger massive buying by funds so that its incorporated into the index.    TLDR: invest in energy
20	0	Hello fellow Apes, I have a tough time figuring out what broker to use and I don‚Äôt know why since the obvious answer is Fidelity or TDAmeritrade. I am currently with Charles Schwab for my broker using their StreetSmartEdge.  My uncle referred me to them and I‚Äôve been using them ever since I started investing and day trading back in September of 2020. They are also my only bank, but starting to move funds over to Fidelity since I have some retirement accounts with them and to see how they are. I like Schwab‚Äôs  platform but it has issues. I‚Äôve ran into some problems with them, such as placing orders above the ask price and it not filling when it should have like today it should have filled for the few seconds my order was up, but they didn‚Äôt go through. Or orders being filled but taking a few seconds to even show up and I have to close the desktop application on windows and log in again to see if the order shows I have a position in the stock and it shows it since I re started the program. I don‚Äôt use Mac OS because StreetSmartEdge is cloud based for Mac and it‚Äôs slow. Or like a couple of times so far when I logged on and the chart, level 2 info, and time and sales being behind by a couple to a few minutes of what Fidelity is showing even though the chart on Schwab and time and sales are showing the present time just the chart values are off, so I restart the program and the information is all right all of a sudden. Almost every time this happens I get mad and say I‚Äôm going to go to Fidelity, but it never happens.   Today I sort of had enough of Schwab‚Äôs platform and think I‚Äôm going to really move to Fidelity. Today I submitted about 7 buy orders before the opening bell well above the ask price by a few cents and they didn‚Äôt fill, I got f***ing pissed!! The Schwab broker said something like the only way the order didn‚Äôt fill is the exchange didn‚Äôt have any sellers below my limit price which is total BS because there weren‚Äôt any other sellers above my limit price and I doubt there weren‚Äôt any NASDAQ sellers at the time and then goes on to say they had issues with orders/ routing them this morning before the bell for like 10-15 minutes. Schwab has again and again had issues.  Apparently schwab and TDAmeritrade will be ‚Äúbecome one‚Äù the representative said like these two companies will finally merge in about summer time of 2023 and then 12 months later schwab and TDA clients will be able to trade using either StreetSmartEdge or TOS with their same account. So I can use TOS one day and SSE the next which is cool, but yeah the problems they have. I‚Äôm not really wanting to wait for that just to use TOS.  I day trade Triple Leverage ETFs on margin, almost completely on margin so some cash but barely any. Usually the max I do is 56% margin against my securities, when schwab the margin requirement  amount for triple leveraged ETFs are 70% but that‚Äôs overnight. Last week I accidentally went with a little over 100% margin with these triple leveraged ETFs for a second. I know this isn‚Äôt as risky as most of you placing huge amounts of life changing option orders that could retire you in minutes or going broke back a literal lifetime and ruining you, but what I do is risky. I love the thrill of always having a somewhat predictable security that makes big swings constantly throughout the day. Some times I place a directed trade so not a auto routed smart trade to buy or sell and immediately as I place the trade the price goes in the direction I want it, but my order isn‚Äôt filled and I need to place another order with a higher limit price, so either I am really good at knowing when to get it and I can see I am good at that, but feels like there‚Äôs a PFOF going on? Idk.  I think I‚Äôll move over the Fidelity, just Schwab seems to be great at mostly everything except for their platform has issues and I have a hard time changing things in my life sometimes.  Help me make the move? I don‚Äôt like having to wait 31 days while switching brokers and not being able to trade these triple leveraged ones to have to avoid cost basis information and all that mess it‚Äôll cause, but I might just have to wait.   What broker do you prefer? I am going to guess most here will say Fidelity because of the whole Citadel PFOF thing that Schwab was a part of with restricting trading on GME back during the squeeze, but I might be wrong with most people here use Fidelity?
744	1	The most recent **"Asia Supply Chain Market Cap 100 Ranking"** provides information on the share performance and valuation of listed firms in Asia's manufacturing supply chains for the year 2021. Despite hurdles such as COVID, harsh weather, geopolitical uncertainty, and the chip crunch, the top ten most valuable companies in Asia supply chains managed to survive, and some even flourished, according to the findings.  With a cut-off date of December 31, 2021, DIGITIMES conducted rankings based on market capitalization data of listed firms engaged in manufacturing activities in Asia supply chains. Tech product/equipment, consumer electronics, semiconductors, electrical components, electronic components, automobile manufacturing, automotive components, and mechanical industries were among the top 100 firms.  67 of the top 100 market cap corporations saw their market worth increase over the previous year, while 31 saw their market value decline.  With a market worth of $576.3 billion as of the last trading day of 2021, **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC)** took first place, up 17.8% from 2020. This may lead one to question how TSMC, a B2B wafer foundry service provider, can beat enterprises with far greater revenues or staff headcounts by such a large margin.  **Samsung** came in second with US$392.8 billion in IT products and equipment but was down 11.6 percent over the same time. Despite the chip crisis that severely hit the global automobile sector, **Toyota Motor** came in third with a revenue of US$298.6 billion and managed to expand by 17.9%.  **In comparison to last year, the top three corporations are in the same order.** The market's acknowledgment of TSMC's competitive edge, as well as the semiconductor industry's essential position in the aftermath of the US-China trade war and the COVID-19 epidemic, explains why the company has consistently ranked first in the market capitalization. "TSMC is unquestionably the world leader in advanced technology R&amp;D and production," said Eric Huang, vice president of DIGITIMES Asia and leader of the survey research team.  TSMC's share price, on the other hand, had mostly consolidated in a relatively narrow range in 2021, with just a minor growth of 16 percent. Because TSMC's stock price increased by 60% in 2020, it's logical that the company would go through a phase of consolidation. Furthermore, demand for foundry services from advanced to mature processing nodes continues to be strong, with a long line of people waiting to be served.  **It's also worth noting the structural shift in IC foundry demand.** TSMC and Samsung are the only two businesses in the world that can deliver advanced processing nodes (7 nm and down), as more companies build their own chips in-house or through fabless design companies for the best performance on their devices.  "With a client portfolio that includes all of the major competitors in the CPU/GPU arena, including Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and MediaTek, as well as ASIC customers like Apple, TSMC's competitive edge, is undeniable," Huang added.  **Samsung Electronics** portrayed a distinct story since it combined display, mobile devices, consumer electronics, and Harman (an American automobile entertainment system maker acquired by Samsung) with the semiconductor business.  In Q3 2021, Samsung's semiconductor division accounted for 35.7 percent of total sales and 63.5 percent of operating profits (Q4 data not available yet). Though its semiconductor sector grew by double digits in revenue and profits year over year, its market cap was dragged down by the poor development of other end product divisions.  While the chip crisis has had a significant impact on most Asian manufacturers, Toyota was one of the few automakers to see its market capitalization climb by double digits. Due to foreign currency translation and a $2.3 billion stock buyback plan that is due in March 2022 to maintain its ROE above 10%, its share price increased by 32% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2021, but the market cap increased by 18% in US dollars.  According to Bloomberg, Toyota was quick to straighten its supply chains and ramp up production to fulfill demand ahead of the other manufacturers during the pandemic's recovery. It predicted an operational profit of JPY 2.5 trillion (about US$22 billion) for the fiscal year ending in March 2022 in May 2021. Toyota's overall sales increased 36 percent year over year in the first half of FY2022 (6 months ended in September 2021), while operating profit exceeded JPY1.7 trillion  Toyota's announcement to invest $70 billion in 100% electric vehicle cars by December 2030 was warmly received by the market, in addition to its strong supply chain management capabilities. Although Toyota's ambition to make 1/3 of its car lineup all-electric by 2030 is more conservative than Volkwagen's 50%, Forbes senior writer said the market consensus appears to have acknowledged Toyota's strategy as a logical approach to the EV evolution.  **CATL** (electrical component), **Sony** (consumer electronics), **Keyence** (tech product and equipment), **BYD** (automotive manufacturing), **Tokyo Electron** (semiconductor), **Midea** (consumer electronics), and **SK Hynix** (consumer electronics) were the companies with the fourth to tenth largest market values among Asian supply chain manufacturers (semiconductor).  In 2021, semiconductor equipment makers and electric vehicle/battery firms, especially battery and EV manufacturers, appeared to be the darlings of Asian capital markets. CATL and BYD's market caps increased by 72.1 percent and 44.2 percent, respectively. Tokyo Electron, one of the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturers, had a 55.1 percent surge in its stock price.

250	1	With the looming sanctions over Russia and a drive to lower the reliance on russian exports, I focused on 3 sectors 1. Fertilizers 2. Nickel 3. Solar energy  1. Fertilizers For those who don't know Russia is the biggest exporter of fertilizer. The speculation is them getting a hit and the hope of this gap being covered by companies established in other countries.  Position: 30 shares of $CF(American)  2. Nickel Nornickel is world's largest nickel mining company.  With similar argument from previous point, alternatives are flying high.  Position:  500 shares of Glencore(Swiss)  3. Solar For this alternatively you can look to buy calls on oil and/or nuclear energy. I'd prefer a Europe based company for this as I feel a push for oil sanctions of Russia will force their prices much higher up here esp in Germany.  Position: 50 shares of SMA Solar Tech(German)  At the moment, I'm up almost 30% on all positions. I think that the stocks in these sectors can go further up in the coming months. Obligatory rockets üöÄüöÄüöÄ  This may or may not be a financial advice.
94	0	In ETFs? Not that everyone is a dumb ape that tries to trade options without having a clue, just because he has seen somewhere someone who made money on a gamble. But really, nowdays every fool buys ETFs, so that might be a good one.      But I'm really curious, what do you think... where will be the sucker? What will be the shit asset class, that won't recover for some time? I mean besides cash and bonds.
103	0	   TL;DR I'm not doing one. I'm typing all this bullshit to help you. You don't want to read it, don't. Go YOLO your shit into Luckin Coffee, you magnificent retard. I love you.  And don't fucking whine about how this is too long. No one cares and I'm tired of this sub being r/whining.  Alright.¬†  The market is ruining your life. You don't know if we're at bottom or not. But the market is sure you're a bottom and it's coming back to fuck you like a prison inmate again.  Retail investors are plowing money into the market like it's a dime store hooker. Hedge funds are selling off to take their money. Then the stock prices drop, people panic sell. Hedge funds buy all those cheap ass stocks you sold.  So stop that shit. You're making us look bad.¬†  I mean fuck. You're get raped two ways and then come back for more? Smarten up.  I know. I know. You want tendies.¬†  Life is hard. You want to stop falling asleep on your couch while the headboard of your bed bangs the wall while your wife's boyfriend puts his no no in her yes yes.  Shut up. Quit crying. Grab some tissues. Listen up.  1) If you have money in the market that you can't live without, take it out.¬†  This is some basic bitch shit. A volatile market is not the place to invest your rent money.¬†  No, I don't want you to be responsible. And I don't give a fuck if you're homeless. I want you to not make dumb, emotional, irrational decisions. That's how we all get out of this mess.  If you already fucked this part up, you can shut up and hold for years. Or you can shut up, sell at a massive loss and give up.  If you're leveraged, quit that shit. Paying 8% interest for money that loses 20% is a bad bet. Stop paying brokers and banks to fuck you.  2) Hedge money.  "Bur but but what the fuck is that? Is it like shrubbing?"  It's cash you keep as cash that you want to invest later or, if you're more into risk, dump some cash into Inverse Etfs (look them up).¬†  Basically, when the market goes down, they go up. If you use them right, you get to keep your stocks and not take a loss or even make a profit on the ETFs (the jury is still out on if gold is a good hedge or not).  "But but but hedging? But but but inflation. I'll lose money if it sits there."  Shut up. Inflation is going away. If you invest right you'll make more than inflation will fuck you. And stop buying dumb shit while inflation is high. Don't fuck yourself. You're already getting fucked.  "Now listen here, dinkface. I don't want to hedge. I want to buy the dip. I'm a big bull. My friends and I show each other our big bull balls and swing our dicks at each other to show that we aren't gay bears."  Shut up. If you want to brag about what kind of animal you are, go to a fucking furry convention. We're here to make money. Money is like your mom. It doesn't care about how big your balls are and it brings me hookers so I can have threesomes with it.  And, shut up, you're still going to buy the dip. But you're going to buy the dip like a man.  What does that mean?  You buy A LITTLE BIT of stocks on the way down (dollar cost averaging, look it up). Buy a LITTLE BIT more every time they have a big dip.  "But but but I don't want to buy a little. I'm a big boy. I buy stocks big. And what if I miss profits? We're already at the bottom."  Shut up. You're going to make a fuck ton less if you assume we're at the bottom, spend all your cash and then can't buy stocks when they're even cheaper. Anyone who says they know where the bottom is at is a liar or an idiot. I called it wrong once. I'll probably do it again.   If shit turns around (and wait till that is 100% confirmed, retard), the market isn't going up 800% in a day. You can buy more on the way up and still make money as stocks recover.  "But but but what is a little bit of buying, daddy?"  Quit the daddy shit. It's cool when your mom says it to me. It's creepy when you say it.  Here's a basic rule that will keep you from shitting yourself as you watch your portfolio bleed like it's got a perpetual period.  (And it's a basic fucking rule. I don't think this shit is going to happen so don't chirp about it.)  Whatever you're investing amount is overall, assume you'll lose 50% of that. If that makes your ass pucker, use less money.¬†  Because that's your total budget. Spend it wisely. Spend it in small amounts.  Lots of idiots plowed all their money back into the market in 2000, 2008 when we were nowhere near bottom. Then they sold at bottom.¬†They hate themselves now. Every minute of every day. Some of them are dead. They died with regret.  Don't be an idiot. Yeah, buying something when it's 20% down feels good. You know what feels better? Buying three times as much of that shit when it's 60% down.  3) Pick your stocks in companies that you will be able to hold for 5 years. Maybe you won't have to hold them that long. Maybe you'll have to hold longer. It's a general rule to give you some direction.   The point is if you buy shit that you have to sell before it recovers, you lose. That's not how buying a dip works. You have to buy it and hold it.  "But but but what do I pick?"  Shut up and choose from these options:  A) Companies that have actual value. If you're smart, look up their p/e p/b ratios. General rule, you want something under 25 p/e and 3 p/b. That's a general rule. Some asshole or kind human will probably give a better benchmark in the comments of this post.  You also want a company that isn't carrying a fuckton of debt. Even when the stock market recovers, things are going to get bad in the economy. If companies go bankrupt you'll be wiping your ass with their stocks.  If you're dumb and don't want to learn simple facts like p/e p/b, just pick big ass companies that don't get destroyed when the economy sucks.¬†  If you want tech, go with Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Not some fucking IPO you heard about from a guy on the bus who probably touches girls while they're sleeping.  B) Buy companies that pay dividends (Google it, I'm not listing them). They'll pay you money even if the stock shits the bed. You may not make money but you'll lose less until things recover.  C) We're going into a recession. I'm not going to explain it. If you think I'm wrong you're the stupidest of the stupid. You should take your money out of the market, buy a gun and shoot your foot off to remind you to be smarter and read basic economic data.  When people realize we're going into a big recession, they will freak out and probably sell a lot of stocks. Don't do that. Plan for it. Plan to buy or plan to hold. Earliest it will hit is probably summer but people will probably start to lose their shit when Q1 earnings start coming in and they suck donkey cock.  In a recession (especially after this wallet raping inflation) people have less money to spend on things they want because they have to spend money on things they need. So don't invest in companies that sell expensive shit that people don't need.  Think on what people buy when they're broke. They buy shit at Dollar Tree and Costco (DLTR COST) They buy food at grocery stores (look up the tickers yourself - not high end grocery stores). They buy fast food instead of eating dinner out (MCD). They buy coke products (I mean the drink - KO). They watch shit on tv (pick a streamer). They still buy alcohol and cigarettes (look them up, I don't buy that shit because I'm ethical as fuck and don't invest in it). Consumer staples like toilet paper and toothpaste (PG JNG). And people still get sick and have to see doctors (UHG).  Buy companies that do well in a recession.¬†  Banks do well in recessions. Banks do well when interest rates are going up (which they are in a big way). Both are happening.  Just know that China's economy is fucked and Russia's economy just got nuked which affected banks all over the world. You might want to see how that global shit works out before you invest in them. Wells Fargo has like 30% short interest right now. That's for a reason.  "But but but my dad buys that stable big value company stocks. I want to buy cool stocks like laser guided robotic cat dildos because I'm awesome. I'm smart, edgy and cool."  Shut up. You're not. And I'll still let you buy those stocks. Just buy less of those and buy the good ones that have actual revenue on the horizon. Research. Like your dad, it's not hard (which is why your mom left him for me).  If you're really fucking smart, you buy a little with the plan to hold. Then, if a bunch or retards pump up a stock 30% based on nothing, sell that shit, wait for it to tank and rebuy.  "But but but HODL! BUY ALL THE DIPS!!!"  Ok. That's fine by me. You're the reason I've made fat cash off of UPST, PLTR, gold and silver (and then rebought them). You're why I made a shitton off of meme stocks last year. Thanks for that.  "But but but what about other investments that I can't talk about here because of this sub's rules?"  I'll be honest, I don't know how that stuff is going to shake out. I am sure that if you invest in a volatile asset and think it's a hedge you're so stupid it hurts your ancestors.  Yeah, it might be. But no one has proven that. Investment patterns don't support that idea being true. Maybe when the NASDAQ is down 20% it isn't a good time to experiment with a new hedge.  Alright. That's it. Now shut up and get back out there. No more whining.  \*THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. IF YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF SOME ANONYMOUS RETARD ONLINE YOU ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AND CAN'T SUE ME LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

632	1	Ford Motor, the second largest U.S. automaker, announced on Friday that it is considering setting up a plant in India to produce electric vehicles for export, which may also be sold in India's domestic market. Just a few months ago, Ford announced its withdrawal from India and stopped selling and producing cars in India due to continuous losses for many years. In the U.S. stock market, Ford's share price did not fluctuate significantly.  https://preview.redd.it/gvnjhzwk3rh81.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcc2abe9dd82abf179e2a31f2c4a5a2b0f79447  Ford's latest remarks mark a shift in its strategic objectives. The company said in September last year that it would bear a loss of about $2 billion and withdraw from the Indian auto market because it could not see a way to make a profit. Ford's decision is also a blow to Indian Prime Minister modi's "make in India" campaign.  Ford has two car factories in India. In a statement on Friday, the company said it was "exploring the possibility of using an Indian factory as an export base for electric vehicle manufacturing."  Asked whether the company would also consider selling electric vehicles in India, a Ford India spokesman said: "there is no specific discussion on this at present, but it will be considered in the future."  In what Ford calls the "global electric vehicle revolution", Ford is increasingly focusing on consumers. The carmaker had previously said it planned to invest $30 billion in electric vehicles and batteries by 2030.  When Ford stopped production in India, its share in the local passenger car market was less than 2%. Ford decided to stop producing new cars in India based on the accumulated losses over the years, the continuous overcapacity of the industry and the unexpected growth of the Indian auto market. However, analysts have a positive attitude towards the business restructuring.  GAURAV vangaal, senior director of production forecasting at IHS Markit, said that if Ford made a decision at a later stage, the Indian market would continue to open the door for it.  Vangaal said it is cost-effective to produce cars in India, and Ford's Indian plant has exported cars to North America and Europe in the past - both regions are now large and growing electric vehicle markets.  "Ford will have to prove that it is cost competitive in making electric vehicles in India, for which it will need a lot of investment to localize its supply chain," he said He added that Ford also needed to figure out how to get lithium-ion batteries.  Before Ford announced its return to India strategy, the Indian government also announced on Friday that 20 auto companies, including Ford and Hyundai, were eligible for the government's $3.5 billion clean energy vehicle award. According to the plan approved by the Indian government last year, the plan will encourage automobile manufacturers to manufacture electric and hydrogen energy vehicles and related parts in the next five years.

670	1	TLDR: Fed won‚Äôt raise rates significantly, hyperinflation is bullish for everything. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª = Fuk‚Äôd  So, Is Russia going to invade Ukraine?? No! I grew up in Europe and forever have we been fearing the Russian invasion, that never ever happens. You know how many times Russia ‚Äúalmost‚Äù took over? Yes, never since the collapse of the USSR, to the contrary, the NATO is Inching closer to Russia, then Russia inching towards us, and we are effectively surrounding Russia on all sides.  Russia is powerful, but can never, ever win against the NATO, it‚Äôs completely unrealistic. Anybody who believes that Russia starts a serious war against the West has completely lost touch with reality. Not even the fucking COLD WAR turned HOT. So stick your anxiety pills up your butthole and relax.  Anyway, how can you make money with this? Looking at the reaction of the market today, it‚Äôs evident, that the entire stock market is completely retarded for contracting due to some White House announcement that‚Äôs obvious distraction from the actual problems. Coincidence that record Inflation numbers are coming out, and they push the same ol Russian shit?  The way to make money is by believing that they will remain irrational, and betting on it.  I made most of my money through Oil, because I knew that environmentalist were gonna shutdown oil supplies, when demand is steadily going up = Oil go up. But people were shorting Oil because Tesla was growing??  Once you understand how retarded the world is, you‚Äôll make money.  The smart thing might be to sell Gold, because fed will raise rates, then bearish for gold and commodities right?!? And buy Puts?!?  Remember to smoothen that brain surface.   The Fed has constantly been lying about inflation being transitory, why would they tell the truth about raising rates significantly?  They are NOT going to cause a recession during an election year, Powell is basically part of the Biden administration. Their 0.25% whatever is going to do nothing against almost 8% CPI and 15% real inflation.  While the bears are celebrating because ‚ÄúInflation will crash the markets‚Äù they are forgetting that the reason inflation crashes the markets is, that interest rates go up.   This time is different because the fed is not going to fight Inflation reasonably, during times of unhinged Inflation, everything goes up.  Yes, stock market, commodities, prices, everything will go up.  Yes, yes, right now we are in a bear market because of expectation of a rise in rates. This ship will most likely reverse as soon as the market realizes that Powell is pluwffing.  So the shorts that are building up right now are going to get so utterly fucked, in one of the biggest market rebounds since 2020. Im aiming for around March - September, and should probably time calls for next year.  This time the dollar will take a massive dump, so you better do something with your money, not financial advice.  P.S.   Dollar will shortly go up during first hike but eventually shit the bed when investors realize that they are not going to do shit.  Hyperinflation is Bullish for everything!

987	0	My $20k amateur investing account (2 years of growth from $5k) was just reduced to $3k cuz I didn‚Äôt want to sell my $12k September LEAPs on NVDA. Also, I kept buying ‚Äúdips‚Äù that just kept dipping.   Corrections typically last 4 months, but JP just extended that by revisiting the rate hikes in March. There is talk of inflation, crashes, same-old covid bullshit. Now we got this Russia vs. Ukraine situation out of nowhere.   Aside: what the fuck do I care about Ukraine. Growing up poor under Obama, democrat presidents are shit for the economy and are great at sticking their noses into literal shit. Absolute disaster.  The point is, I‚Äôm just a bag holder who‚Äôs malding. But that‚Äôs part of the game. And no one knows when it‚Äôs gonna hit the bottom so we can get out of this mess. Most will probably dig themselves deeper, like me.   Anyway, this could have all been avoided if I wasn‚Äôt a pussy retard and sold my shit when I was only down by $3k. In the comment section below, I would like to accumulate answers to this question, ‚Äúwhen should I sell my shit?‚Äù So I can learn my lesson. I want to know under what situations should I just cut my losses and dip out of the market when faced with some big fuckin macroscopic disaster.  For example: Trade war‚Äî&gt; sell your shit Virus ‚Äî&gt; sell your shit Rate hike/inflation ‚Äî&gt; sell your shit Etc‚Ä¶ just put all the circumstances down there.

However, if China decides to rebuke Russia, I‚Äôd like to think it would that it would be better for them financially. If they side with Russia or remain on the fence, could it create more loss despite a recent uptick? I think so.  There‚Äôs a huge gamble in either direction that will pay off well depending on China‚Äôs position on Russia next week.

I primarily trade active stocks, with heavy focus on ETF's SPY and QQQ.     To those that day trade, and hold positions for minutes, what is it best to do?   ITM or OTM contracts?   If you miss the dip, on an OTM contract and the stock goes down from your original position, is this less of a loss, than if it was ITM?  Thanks!

203	1	McDonalds has been dropping for a little over two months now. In total, it has dropped nearly 20% since it hit all time highs near $270 per share. It is now that I see a reversal happening in the stock however. It's drop coincided with a drop in the general market and was accelerated recently by news that McDonald's was closing stores temporarily in Russia. It has gotten to the point where MCD is now extremely oversold.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/7naLkVdq  Seen in the image above, the rsi for MCD is well into the oversold territory indicating that at the very least, a sympathy bounce is bound to occur. Additionally, MCD bounced perfectly on the 78.6% retracement from it's rally from $200 to $270. Adding to the strength of this support is that this level previously served as resistance back in early Feb. Though this is the first time that level has been tested as support, it did successfully bounce on the level indicating it's strength. I believe that the bounce today in MCD will continue and that will be a good play for those looking into shares or calls. If you're going with calls, I would do further out and closer to the money to protect yourself a little. The volatility of the market makes everything somewhat unpredictable. If we are all lucky, maybe we can buy a happy meal with the profits.   Positions: MCD 220C 4/14

636	0	Has the stock market ever been in more uncertain times? Inflation has never been this high in 40 years. Our government says chances are at least 50% Russia invades Ukraine which will cause huge effects on our economy once we put up sanctions on goods and worsen inflation dramatically.

256	1	For a variety of fundamental and technical reasons I believe that the options market is not currently in convergence with the futures market regarding wheat pricing. I feel that the volatility premium, while high, simply fails to account for the fact that wheat is a commodity, not some coinbase listing.  Wheat is currently at overbought on the daily candle RSI, it is trading at all time high prices, and is experiencing a large amount of retail volume from people like us.  The WEAT ETF is currently experiencing 20 million in share volume while average used to be in 4-6 million share range. This, combined with sentiment analysis of wallstreetbets, stocktwits, etc. show that wheat prices, at least in this ETF, will be artificially pumped by retail volume rather than institutional worries regarding wheat prices.  While Russia and Ukraine are some of the largest exporters of wheat, the US Midwest and Southeastern harvests of wheat occur in the mid spring and early summer, ending in approximately Juneish. Of course, futures price this in. Nearly everything is priced in. Increased supply = lower price of wheat = ETF goes down.   Yet I feel that the ETF itself will return to its normal price in the 5-8 dollar range with the harvests of wheat adding supply to the markets, resolution or development in the Russia/Ukraine conflict, and the simple fact that companies are simply scrambling for wheat right now. The futures expire THIS MONTH, so we can reasonably expect prices to be elevated as buyers and sellers try to figure out a market without Russia or Ukraine.  Additionally, I feel that retail traders, who tend to bias stocks more towards the upside (and bought this ETF in the 10-12 dollar range by the time it trended) will start to exit their positions as they realize the overextension in wheat's bull run is not sustainable. After seeing a decline in trading volume (which caused the pump in the first place) I see a selloff in the future in order to align with the more reasonable futures prices.   TLDR there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of wheat bag holders who bought the second they saw it trending up 30%. Estimating the top of this insanity to be around $13-$13.50 a share in the next few days. Futures are pricing in this decline but this ETF is gonna see a selloff that options haven‚Äôt accounted for.   Positions: I‚Äôm planning to enter Apr 22 and Jul 15 puts (11p and 10p respectively) sometime tomorrow if WEAT hits my price target.
114	1	Mortgage rates are now 4% about and will rise. Savings rates will too and those two things will divert wealth...money. Mortgage rates rising will increase a banks assets and savings rates will increase the liabilities. But it‚Äôs like oil going up and gas following and then oil falls and gas plateaus. The current ratio of banks will improve. Both rates take money out of typical(not the finance industry) markets. People will save more, a little across the whole country is actually a lot, and that, in theory, lowers demand. IN THEORY. The extra few bucks on the mortgage rates lowers demand too. Lower demand means lower prices. This money inevitably probably just is paid out to individuals at the banks in the form of bonuses and salary increases. So I‚Äôd say a play could be luxury brands. Possibly banks too but, I believe, that‚Äôs old news.   Most importantly rate increases are to slow down an economy bc things are good. That has always been the case.

I've been taking a look at their stock recently because I have two Capital One cards that I like a lot and because their low P/E ratio of only 5.13 is very attractive to me.   If you look at the chart, you'll notice that it has dropped a lot since February but is starting to recover pretty well and I'm thinking about about taking a position until they reach close to their high again. In the current market it's too risky to buy options but shares should be good.   https://preview.redd.it/x825duskhno81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3f2e5dbd9cf225f553f3f2a4732fb766b462364  Lastly, and I found this out from the Wikipedia page, but Capital One's CEO is named Rich Fairbank which should make very well-suited for the job lol.

What this really is telling you is that the MMs are in need of SPY shares, probably because every customer they have is shorting. Also you will notice, if you use a real broker, that SPY is currently hard to borrow(HTB). You are probably correct on the rally followed by big down leg.

597	1	   Reddit is currently the most popular search engine. The only people who don‚Äôt know that are the team at Reddit, who can‚Äôt be bothered to build a decent search interface. So instead we resort to using Google, and appending the word ‚Äúreddit‚Äù to the end of our queries.  Paul Graham thinks this image means Reddit as a social media site ‚Äústill hasn‚Äôt peaked‚Äù. What it actually means is that the amount of people using Reddit as a search engine is growing.  üì∑  Why are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust.  ## How do we know Google is dying?  If you‚Äôve tried to search for a recipe or product review recently, I don‚Äôt need to tell you that Google search results have gone to shit. You would have already noticed that the first few non-ad results are SEO optimized sites filled with affiliate links and ads.  Google still gives decent results for many other categories, especially when it comes to factual information. You might think that Google results are pretty good for you, and you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about.  What you don‚Äôt realize is that you‚Äôve been self-censoring yourself from searching most of the things you would have wanted to search. You already know subconsciously that Google isn‚Äôt going to return a good result.  I‚Äôm far from the only one who thinks Google is dying:  [Daniel Gross](https://dcgross.com/a-new-google)  &gt;In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren‚Äôt using Google anymore.  [Ask HN: Has Google search become quantitatively worse?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29392702)  &gt;The results keep getting "refined" so as to suit the popular 80% of queries, while getting much worse for any technical or obscure queries. Forced synonyms and "people also searched for" are typically useless and almost infuriating. Once you get off the first or second page, the results get even worse-- with pages entirely unrelated to the query (e.g. not even containing the searched phrases). They are probably testing/already implemented some sort of multi armed bandit type optimization like on Youtube's search results where they just show any popular pages (ignoring relevancy) to see if they yield a click.  [Michael Seibel](https://twitter.com/mwseibel/status/1477701120319361026):  &gt;A recent small medical issue has highlighted how much someone needs to disrupt Google Search. Google is no longer producing high quality search results in a significant number of important categories.   &gt;   &gt;Health, product reviews, recipes are three categories I searched today where top results featured clickbait sites riddled with crappy ads. I‚Äôm sure there are many more.  [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1477760548787920901)  &gt;This may not just be a problem with Google but possibly also the recipe for beating Google. A startup usually has to start with a niche market. Why not try writing a search engine specifically for some category dominated by SEO spam?  ## Why is Google dying?  ### Ads  It is obvious that serving ads creates misaligned incentives for search engines. The founders of Google pointed this out themselves when they were just getting started.  [Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page (1998)](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html)  &gt;‚ÄúCurrently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users‚Ä¶we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers‚Ä¶Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.‚Äù  Unfortunately, these thoughts on the failings of ad-based search engines read like an instruction manual for what Google did next.  They‚Äôve dialed it up to the max recently to squeeze out every last cent before their inevitable collapse.  üì∑  ### SEO  There are tons of people whose sole job is to game their way to the top of Google, so it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising when search results deteriorate in quality. To be fair, this would probably be an issue with any search engine, but you‚Äôd expect Google to be able to come up with a less gameable algorithm.  Here‚Äôs a [fun story](https://alexskra.com/blog/the-mermaid-is-taking-over-google-search-in-norway/) about how one website gamed their way to the top of Google in Norway.  ### AI  Google increasingly does not give you the results for what you typed in. It tries to be ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and figure out what you ‚Äúreally meant‚Äù, in addition to personalizing things for you. If you really meant exactly what you typed, then all bets are off.  Even the exact match query operator (‚Äú ‚Äù) [doesn‚Äôt give exact matches anymore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27052634), which is quite bizarre.  ## Why are people appending ‚Äúreddit‚Äù to their queries?  There‚Äôs a fun conspiracy theory that popped up recently called the [Dead Internet Theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/). The claim is basically that most of the internet is bots. There aren‚Äôt real people here anymore.  [IlluminatiPirate](https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php?threads/dead-internet-theory-most-of-the-internet-is-fake.3011/):  &gt;TLDR: Large proportions of the supposedly human-produced content on the internet are actually generated by artificial intelligence networks in conjunction with paid secret media influencers in order to manufacture consumers for an increasing range of newly-normalised cultural products.  This isn‚Äôt true (yet), but it reflects some general sense that the authentic web is gone. The SEO marketers gaming their way to the top of every Google search result might as well be robots. Everything is commercialized. Someone‚Äôs always trying to sell you something. Whether they‚Äôre a bot or human, they are decidedly fake.  So how can we regain authenticity? What if you want to know what a genuine real life human being thinks about the latest Lenovo laptop?  You append ‚Äúreddit" to your query (or hacker news, or stack overflow, or some other community you trust).  Google is dead.  Long live Google + ‚Äúsite:reddit.com‚Äù.  *If you are interested in more thoughts and ideas on search and organizing information, you may want to follow me on twitter* [*@dkb868*](https://twitter.com/dkb868)*.*  ## Appendix 1: response from Google.  ### Google claims the exact matching feature is merely unintuitive, not broken  [Danny Sullivan](https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/1493702054673485826):  &gt;I work for Google Search, passed your feedback along, thanks. You said in the post that quotes don't give exact matches. They really do. Honest. Put a word or phrase in quotes, that's what we'll match. If anyone has an example where they feel it doesn't, please let me know...   &gt;   &gt;Here's why people often think quoting with Google doesn't work when it really does (I've looked a huge number of these reports).   We match ALT text   We match text not readily visible, such as in a menu or small text   Page has changed since we indexed it   Punctuation...   &gt;   &gt;Punctuation comes into play if you did a quoted search like "dog cat" and there's text that says "dog, cat" then we'll see that without the punctuation. That doesn't seem a major issue but we're looking at if we could improve there.  ### And Google seems to be right so far  Every example of exact matching not working so far can be traced back to issues with punctuation, alt text, etc.  For example, one proposed [failing query](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355528) was "quotes don't give". But HN user [saalweachter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30356152) has pointed out that it is a very intricate punctuation problem.  &gt;For instances, on the \["quotes don't give"\] example, the first result I get is https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/never-give-up   &gt;   &gt;If I do a find-in-page for "quotes don't give", I get zero results. Oh no! Perfidy!   &gt;   &gt;... but, if you look more closely, you'll find this string waaaaay down at the bottom:   &gt;   &gt;tags: don-t-give-up, don-t-give-up-on-your-dreams, don-t-give-up-on-yourself, don-t-give-up-quotes, don-t-give-up-the-fight, encouragement, ...   &gt;   &gt;Thanks to the wonders of tokenization, that "don-t-give-up-quotes, don-t-give-up-the-fight" gives you the string of tokens, "don t give up quotes don t give up the fight", which contains the exact phrase "quotes don t give", which is the tokenization of the phrase "quotes don't give".  ## Appendix 2: Google just had record profits, you are obviously wrong, and Google isn't dying.  I never said that Google wasn't making money. In fact, if Google really is squeezing every last cent out of ads without regard to search quality, I would expect their revenue to be at an all time high.  I am saying that the quality of search results are declining. This may eventually lead to a decrease in revenue, but has not yet.  ## Apendix 3: Seriously, what are you talking about? My search results are perfect.  If you think your search results are perfect (without appending reddit), then you're probably right. If every single person agreed that Google search results were trash, then Google would already be bankrupt.  Perhaps it is more likely that 80% of people think Google is good enough, and 20% think Google sucks.  I do suspect that the 20% will be growing in number though.  ## Appendix 4: *Yawn*, this is the 87th time someone has claimed that Google search is dying in the last 20 years. This is a big meme in the SEO world.  *"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated" - Google, probably*  You're right, there's been a new article bashing Google every few months for the last 20 years straight. It's probably nothing.  Still, it is a bit interesting that this short and simple post is now one of the most upvoted things of all time on Hacker News. There must be a lot of people who resonate with it this time around.  Hard to tell if something significant has changed.  ## Appendix 5: Random redditor explains it succinctly  [u/a\_latvian\_potato](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/st9ri1/comment/hx3zubc/):  &gt;I think I understand what this article is trying to say. It's not saying that Google's search technology is worse or that people don't use Google to search. It's saying that people trust less of the results Google shows compared to seeing discussions of it on Reddit.   &gt;   &gt;For instance, if I'm looking to see reviews of the Honda Civic 2022 or whatever, I actually do find myself typing "Honda Civic review reddit" instead of "Honda Civic review". This is because I want to see what real people and enthusiasts (on r/cars or whatever) are talking about the car, rather than the top results at Google which are basically just paid reviews advertising the car anyway.   &gt;   &gt;Even though I kinda know people in Reddit are just as capable of spouting BS that are completely wrong, I find the discussions more authentic anyway than the corporate speak the "big websites" have on their articles that Google shows me.

963	0	Back in 2020 I was just about 1 year into my trading career. I watched March 2020 go by and really didn't buy anything. I had no idea what to expect along with the rest of the world and also was very wet behind the ears with trading. One thing I promised myself after witnessing the recovery was that I would not watch the next big dip buy opportunity go by. I would be ready. I really had no idea what stocks to buy back then either -  and in hindsight there were a ton of great bargains outside of tech that turned out to be solid 1-2 year swings like Autozone, DHR, PSA, Chipotle, Lowes and Home Depot, Autonation, Walker Dunlap, and a ton of others. All of these stocks dropped hard while a select group of work from home stocks ripped to the upside. I'm talking about ZOOM, Pelaton, biotech plays, stuff like that. Then we saw the rest of the tech sector pick up and rebound after some light bleeding (relative to the rest of the market). The stimulus played a big part in the way things rebounded for sure. But I'm also thinking that the recovery we witnessed was largely due to the fact that the sell-off was an over-reaction and shorts were piling into positions like never before. Then after things reversed they got greedy and just kept shorting and got squeezed out hard. We saw short squeezes everywhere. Usually when EVERYONE is talking about shorting and buying Puts, it is time for calls and for going long. Most of the tech companies that are down (Netflix, Roku, Now, Adsk, Pypl, Sq, Crm, Shopify, Paycom) are all making more money than ever before. The last few years were fruitful for all of them. They are all testing levels we have not seen but a handful of times in history relative to the overall chart (200 ma on the weekly and the 50 ma on the monthly time frames). These companies are making the same money but now trading at a significant discount. P/e ratios under 40 for Netflix now. Can't beat it. If this isn't the time to buy, I don't know when is. The high volatility we are seeing is pushing some of these good stocks down further than reason would typically allow. Take advantage of it ! I know I am !

617	0	after losing most of my money on options, ive come to realize that the best way to make consistent gains is to have more money to put in the market.  enter the plan i came up with after failing my geology exam.   1. apply for fafsa and use my scholarship to pay my tuition.  2. apply for my university covid relief fund, exaggerate the numbers to receive the full $10,000  3. create an LLC  4. apply for a small business loan through my LLC using the fafsa &amp; covid money as collateral to make up for my lack of business history, aim for $50,000 at 4% apr (made these numbers up in my head)  5. deposit the money directly into my ‚ÄúLLC‚Äôs‚Äù brokerage and enable margin trading to get up to 8x leverage with 7% margin interest.  6. my LLC will have gone from $20,000 cash to $400,000 in buying power (20x leverage) which will strictly be used on options to provide even more leverage.   7. beat 11% to pay down interest, keep the profit. even a 20% year ($80,000) would net me $36,000 after paying interest. this is more than my original collateral.  8. if my LLC loses all of its money, the company will declare bankruptcy and i will lose the collateral but i will not be liable for the $400,000 in losses.
771	1	One bad quarter for Meta and suddenly half the reddit investing community suddenly thinks they are smarter than Mark Zuckerberg.  I am not going to waste time wading into the litany of bear case scenarios that everyone has brilliantly laid out now that the stock has already lost like 40% from ATH. (*Congrats on the post-mortem brilliance. You guys are real fucking geniuses by the way.*)   In regards to the bear case, let‚Äôs suffice it to say that yeah, Facebook and ol Zuck could have a bad year or two.  But if you were ever going to stop yoloing dailies for a few days and actually take a long term position in your life, you‚Äôd be an absolute smooth brain not to try to scoop up some meta for your retirement.  Instead of puking bullshit about forward P/E, Daily Active Users, revenue per users, time spent in app, and some subjective opinion about whether or not we are going to live with screens on our faces, let‚Äôs just talk about Mark.  My position is pretty simple. **Mark Zuckerberg is a once in a generation CEO and you are simply misinformed if you do not see it**.  Sure he may not come across as the most charismatic Chad out there, and he may not have funny tweets. Perhaps is sense of fashion is shitty. Maybe he does need a better hair cut. And he should probably get some more media training before he testifies in front of congress again.  But the man is a fucking super genius and has a proven track record of being ridiculously competent.  He is literally **on a trajectory to be the most successful human being in the history of American capitalism**.  He isn‚Äôt even middle aged, and he has already achieved as much as - or MORE than - every other billionaire out there.  Let‚Äôs take a moment and compare the ages of some major achievers to Mr. Zuckerberg.  &amp;#x200B;  * **Elon Musk** \- Age 50 - Sold PayPal at 30, started SpaceX at age 31 became CEO of Tesla at age 37 * **Jeff Bezos** \- Age 58 - Founded Amazon.com at age 30 * **Warren Buffett** \- Age 91 - Publicly listed Berkshire Hathaway at age 32 * **Sundar Pichai** \- Age 49 - Hired as CEO of Google at age 42 * **Tim Cook** \- Age 61 - Became CEO of Apple at age 50 * **Steve Jobs** \- Deceased - Invented the iPod at age 46, iPhones at age 52 * **Bill Gates** \- Age 66 - Released Windows 95 and took the PC world by storm at age 41. * **Jen-Hsun Huang** \- Age 58 - Co-founded Nvidia at age 30 * **Lisa Su** \- Age 52 - Became AMD CEO at age 44. * **Mark Cuban** \- Age 63 - Sold broadcast.com and became a billionaire at age 40 * **JK Rowling** \- Age 56 - Published Harry Potter at 32 * **Oprah Winfrey** \- Age 68 - Started Oprah Winfrey show at age 32 * **Jamie Dimon** \- Age 65 - Became CEO of JPMorgan Chase at age 52  As you can see, pretty much all of these people didn‚Äôt even start their path to major success until their 30‚Äôs or later.  And I did not just cherry pick old CEO‚Äôs and famous people. This is the story for pretty much everyone who is ultra successful. I mean, look at the dinosaurs who have climbed their way up DC to run America.  I digress.  # Mark Zuckerberg - Age 37 - Founded Facebook at age 20. 1 billion users by age 26. Founded Meta at age 37.  Newsflash fuckwads. Zuckerberg is young enough to be friends with Justin Bieber.  In terms of age, Mark Zuckerberg surpassed the business success of all those other leaders at an age when they were all still going to college parties and trying to get laid.  Today, Zuckerberg is arguably one of the most important people on Earth, his company influences politics and global affairs to an extent that would have given Julius Caesar a 3-day hardon.  Facebook is so big and powerful than American legislators are literally - and rightfully - afraid of it‚Äôs influence on your mind.  And this was NOT an accident. I don‚Äôt care that the idea for his website came from those Winklefucks. Using the internet to have people interact and post photos with people was NOT a unique concept at the time. There were ENDLESS website and communities trying do this very same thing in the early 2000s. I remember, because unlike all you TikTokin zoomers, I was alive and there:  * MSN * MySpace * Nexopia * Friendster * Hi5 * Second Life * Photobucket * Forums * Chatrooms * AND MILLIONS OF SHITTY SEGMENTED ONLINE COMMUNITIES MADE IN HTML  But guess what? At the ripe old age of 23, Mark Zuckerberg saw the trend and built Facebook out from basically nothing. *His* website is the one that took over the world, *not* all those others that were trying and had limitless access to capital via the dot com bubble.  He essentially pioneered social media, which is now the dominant cultural medium in our world.   He did it once, and there's a reasonably good chance he can do it again.  And all these little children in the world have spent the formative years of their childhood LIVING on screens. They will flock to a metaverse when it is developed.  If you look at a comparison in career between Zuck and Musk, **Zuck is pretty much at the life stage where Musk was when he was rich from PayPal and thinking about Tesla and SpaceX**.  All those problems you have identified with AR/VR and iOS privacy and shit? I am sure he will figure it out. He is smarter than all of us, and he's still going to running marathons when Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are admitted to a seniors housing facility.  I am fucking LONG on Mark Zuckerberg, because his career is literally just getting started.
555	1	The international market focuses on the US economy and the situation in Russia and Ukraine. In the US economy, geopolitical risks triggered market changes, and traders lowered their bets on the Fed's interest rate rise of 50 basis points in March; The Fed may need to take "runaway action" now; Goldman Sachs strategists say the labor market has become a key word in the earnings conference call of U.S. companies. In terms of the situation in Russia and Ukraine, the shelling incident in Ukraine rekindled the fear of invasion, and Russia expelled American diplomats; Ukraine and the Separatists accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement. In addition, the U.S. automotive safety regulator investigated Tesla's "ghost brake" problem; Nissan plans to develop electric vehicles in Mississippi; In recent months, the contract has been at a substantial premium, and the oil price curve shows that the degree of market tightness is rare in history.  **Bloomberg: geopolitical risks triggered market changes. Traders cut their bets on the Fed's interest rate rise of 50 basis points in March**  Swap market traders currently expect that the Fed is more likely to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its March meeting than by 50 basis points.  Although higher than expected inflation and the Fed's obvious hawkish stance triggered speculation about a more substantial interest rate hike earlier this month, a series of recent geopolitical news has boosted risk aversion, and a 25 basis point interest rate hike seems more likely. The minutes of the Fed meeting released on Wednesday did not reveal any important clues about the sharp interest rate hike, which also encouraged traders to bet on 25 basis points.  The tightening situation in Russia and Ukraine stimulated the buying of US Treasury bonds on Thursday, and the short-term yield fell. The overnight index swap (OIS), linked to the time of the Fed's interest rate meeting in March, expects the federal funds target rate to be about 35 basis points higher than the current real effective rate of 0.08%. Given that the Fed's rate hike is usually a multiple of 25 basis points, OIS price indicates that traders believe that at least 25 basis points will be added in March, but the possibility of 50 basis points is only about 40%.  Compared with a few days ago, this is an obvious change. At the opening of trading on Wednesday, the market price reflected that the interest rate may rise by about 40 basis points in March, indicating that the possibility of raising the interest rate by 50 basis points is relatively greater.  **CNBC: Fed Brad said inflation "could get out of control" and now action is needed**  St. Louis Fed chairman James Bullard warned on Thursday that inflation could become a more serious problem if the Fed did not take interest rate action.  Brad said, "our generation now faces greater risks than ever before, which may get out of control. One situation is that we are facing an unexpected new accident, and we may have higher inflation. This is the kind of situation we want to ensure will not happen."  Brad recently attracted market attention for calling on the fed to take hawkish action. He advocated raising interest rates by one percentage point by July to deal with the worst inflation in 40 years.  In his speech on Thursday, Brad reiterated his proposition that the Fed should raise interest rates "ahead of schedule" to curb inflation.  "Overall, I think the idea that inflation will dissipate at some point in the future has been overemphasized and focused," Brad said. "We face the risk that inflation will not dissipate. 2022 will be the second consecutive year of fairly high inflation. So that's why in this case, the Fed should act faster and more actively than in other cases."  **Bloomberg: Goldman Sachs strategists say the labor market has become a key word in the earnings conference call of U.S. companies**  Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group said that the historically rare tight labor market, low unemployment and rising wage inflation are squeezing profit margins, leaving U.S. companies struggling to cope.  Strategists led by David J. kostin said that through the analysis of the fourth quarter earnings conference call of S &amp; P 500 index companies, it can be seen that many companies are raising salaries to attract workers when the labor force participation rate is still lower than the pre epidemic level, which puts pressure on corporate profits. Although the salary growth rate has reached the fastest in decades, the manpower problem still exists, which is also one of the reasons for the interruption of the supply chain.  "Supply chain disruptions continue to affect profitability, and it is unclear when these problems will be resolved," kostin wrote in a report. "The recent quarterly earnings conference call shows that there is more uncertainty about how long these interruptions will last and how far we are from normalization."  Nevertheless, kostin said that companies that took action at the beginning of supply chain problems could protect profit margins, and said analysts underestimated the strength of corporate profits at the beginning of the earnings season. Goldman Sachs also recommends focusing on high-quality companies with strong balance sheets, stable profit margins and the ability to protect profits in times of input cost inflation.  **Reuters: Ukrainian shelling rekindles fears of invasion, Russia expels U.S. diplomats**  The shelling incident in Ukraine on Thursday once again raised concerns about Russia's imminent invasion. U.S. President Joe Biden said Moscow was looking for an excuse for a possible attack. The Kremlin expelled an American diplomat.  Ukrainian government forces exchanged fire with Pro Russian separatists in the early morning. Western countries said the invasion could happen at any time.  Although Russia accused the west of hysteria and said that some Russian troops had returned to their bases and had no invasion plans, many western countries insisted that the military build-up continued.  **WSJ: Ukraine and separatists accuse each other of violating the ceasefire agreement**  Pro Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government accused each other of violating the ceasefire on the tense front of the confrontation on Thursday, while Western officials said Moscow continued to build up troops on the border of smaller neighboring Ukraine.  Representatives of Luhansk people's Republic and Donetsk people's Republic, two separate regions in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, said that the Ukrainian armed forces fired grenades and mortars into their territory. The two separated regions have received Russian support and weapons and equipment provided by Russia.  The Ukrainian military said that within 24 hours as of 7 a.m. local time, Russian controlled forces violated the ceasefire agreement in eight places, using mortars, anti tank grenades and small arms. Late Thursday, Ukrainian state media said a shell hit a kindergarten building.  The Donbas conflict began in 2014. Although a ceasefire agreement was reached a year later, this kind of exchange of fire still occurred frequently, with occasional large-scale fighting. But now, with Russia and Western countries engaged in a wider confrontation over Ukraine, the risk of conflict has increased.  **WSJ: US auto safety regulator investigates Tesla's "ghost brake" problem**  The U.S. auto safety regulator is investigating the problem of consumers' non warning braking of Tesla Inc.'s best-selling models, the latest investigation related to the electric vehicle manufacturer's advanced driving assistance functions.  The survey disclosed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Commission (NHTSA) on Thursday covered about 416000 model 3 cars and model y compact sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in 2021 and 2022.  The agency said it had received more than 350 complaints about the problem of non warning braking, also known as "phantom braking".  These complaints allege that the ghost braking problem occurred when autopilot's advanced driving assistance function was enabled.  **Reuters: Nissan plans to develop electric vehicles in Mississippi**  Nissan announced Thursday that it would invest $500 million to restructure its U.S. assembly plant near Canton, Mississippi, to produce two new electric vehicles.  The company said it plans to assemble electric vehicles for its Nissan and Infiniti brands in Mississippi from 2025. It aims to account for 40% of the sales of electric vehicles in the U.S. market by 2030.  A Nissan executive revealed that the company is seeking to establish a battery plant in the United States.  **Bloomberg: the sharp premium oil price curve of contracts in recent months shows that the degree of market tightness is rare in history**  During this round of sharp fluctuations in benchmark oil prices, the crude oil futures curve shows that the market is in one of the strongest periods in history.  Brent's price fluctuated sharply to more than $90 this week, but it fluctuated more in the market structure.  The sharp premium of recent month contracts over forward contracts shows that traders are now scrambling to buy oil. Some futures spreads have reached the highest level since relevant data were available in 2007.  This is most clearly reflected in the world's most important physical crude oil price: the spot Brent crude oil spot price hit US $100 per barrel on Wednesday, the first time since 2014. In recent weeks, the North Sea spot market has flourished. With the surge in demand from European refineries, some physical price spreads have reached an all-time high.  "The strength of spot Brent clearly indicates that refiners are purchasing short-term supply," energy aspects analysts including amrita Sen wrote in a report to customers this week. "The only way to balance this market in the medium term is still to slow down demand growth with high oil prices."

975	0	Just look at the map. Ukrainian territory extends like a peninsula into Russia. It‚Äôs about 300 miles from north west corner of Ukraine to Moscow and about 300 miles from south west Ukrainian border to Caspian sea, where Russia has its strategic oil reserves. Of course Russians will never allow Ukraine to become a member of NATO. It‚Äôs obvious. They learned their lesson from Stalingrad well. They will annex Eastern Ukraine to eliminate this vulnerability, just like they annexed Crimea, where they have their vital deep water navy port. The rhetoric from the West is not helpful. It feels like the military industrial complex is gearing up for the next Cold War. Unlimited budget for their toys. Ukrainians‚Ä¶ what are they thinking while pushing for NATO membership? It‚Äôs like poking an angry bear who is 28 times bigger than you with a wooden stick. They could have tried minding their own business while building an economically and militarily strong state just like Israel did. Anyway, it‚Äôs very likely that Russians are not joking this time. Their single largest trade partner is China. Their oligarchs spend money in Dubai. Average Russians live much better lives than 20 years ago and DO support Putin like a tzar. So sell all digital currency shit you are still holding, as well as stocks that are not military related, buy gold and maybe U.S. dollar and pray for not getting nuked.

759	1	I've traded this one on and off based around the FDA approval. For the nth time it seems like approval is imminent and they're rallying big time. For anyone unfamiliar, they have a glucose monitoring system that only needs to be replaced every 180 days instead of the industry standard 30. All their trial data looks great, and they've been waiting on the FDA to greenlight the system, and they keep pushing off the approval due to being backlogged with Covid.   They issued solid guidance recently and made a statement that approval was "imminent" in the coming weeks. I timed my entry poorly a few days before Omicron news hit and have been bagholding since November but it's really been taking off the past few days and I'm solidly green now. I'm wondering if it's starting to get priced in for the approval.   I'm thinking this is an easy 3x bagger if you got in around 2-$2.20 or so and at this point there's still a solid potential for 50% or maybe even 100% after approval hits. If we get a new covid variant in the next couple weeks it might deflate the momentum but otherwise I'm feeling really good about this one.
